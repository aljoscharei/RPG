While the community might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.

E Profoundly corrupt guild boss, Ambitious newcomer with brutal methods, Ruthless leader of a guild of criminals

F Hard-bitten elder among the workers, Outsider trying to make room here, Reformer seeking to oust the corrupt guild heads

C The guilds have intermarried or entangled themselves with the ostensible rulers, The guilds offer protection from a real or imagined threat, They guilds hate each other only slightly less than the competition

T Priceless symbolic guild regalia, Wealth hidden by the former ruler of the community, Money earned by shady business practices

P Bustling guild hall, Purely decorative ruler’s court, Shabby worker’s housing
