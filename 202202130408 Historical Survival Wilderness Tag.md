Some small community or remnant group of an ancient empire persists here. They may have been a colony planted before the empire’s fall, an outside group that inherited the culture after conquest or subsumption, a chronological distortion cast out of time, a group held in stasis that recently awoke, or some other remnant of a greater past. They may or may not have a clear idea of the present world, but may preserve knowledge of now-lost strongholds and points of power once held by their ancestors.

E Embittered revanchist ruler, Vengeful chieftain who blames the world, Transhuman leader of incomprehensible cognition

F Heritor curious about outsiders, Desperate chief in need of outside help, Determined preserver of ancient identity

C The empire they belonged to was infamous, They’re only notionally human, They make deals with rebels and exiles of neighboring lands

T Long-preserved ancient regalia, Now-lost relic in common use in their empire, Secret lore to unlock hidden storehouses of their people

P Crumbling and dilapidated public building, Crude shrine with too-advanced salvaged ornaments, Passages kept secret from the world
