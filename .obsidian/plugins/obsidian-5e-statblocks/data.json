A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it.

Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour.

The nightmare can now take control of the body – when the nightmare is   in control, the victim retains no memories of its dees or events during that time. The nightmare can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics and surface knowledge, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s secrets, class features, or proficiencies. Its armor class is 10 plus the target’s Dexterity modifier and its to-hit value is its proficiency bonus plus the higher of the target’s Strength or Dexterity modifiers. The possession lasts until the creature is slain, the nightmare ends it as a bonus action, or the nightmare is turned or forced out by an effect like the [[5e spells Symbaroum Rituals Exorcism]] spell. When the possession ends, the nightmare reappears in an unoccupied space with- in 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this nightmare’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
