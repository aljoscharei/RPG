Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process. If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated."

Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends.

When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the effect ends. A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful 24 Strength (Athletics) check to swim at all during that turn."

The nightmare can now take control of the body – when the nightmare is   in control, the victim retains no memories of its dees or events during that time. The nightmare can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics and surface knowledge, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s secrets, class features, or proficiencies. Its armor class is 10 plus the target’s Dexterity modifier and its to-hit value is its proficiency bonus plus the higher of the target’s Strength or Dexterity modifiers. The possession lasts until the creature is slain, the nightmare ends it as a bonus action, or the nightmare is turned or forced out by an effect like the [[5e spells Symbaroum Rituals Exorcism]] spell. When the possession ends, the nightmare reappears in an unoccupied space with- in 5 feet of the body.

Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag)."
