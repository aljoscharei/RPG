In a former age some tyrant or artist sculpted an entire landform here into a statue, monument, or artwork that is visible for miles. A carved mountainside, a molded hill, an intricate pattern of waterways, a mesa pierced with music-emitting tunnels, or some other huge artwork is obvious here, and probably can be seen from any point nearby.
