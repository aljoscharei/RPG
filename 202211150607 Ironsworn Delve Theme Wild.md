Despite our attempts to extend our control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our shields against tooth and claw, our wits against insidious creatures, and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the prey.
