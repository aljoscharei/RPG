The community used to be much richer, but something happened recently to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.

E Outside profiteer squeezing the newly-poor, Local monopolizing the remaining income, Demagogue blaming everything on their enemy

F Plucky local trying to make a new go of things, Harried disburser of limited charity, Riches-to- rags native trying to maintain their dignity

C Their loss is a rival’s gain, Someone’s offering them a new industry at a terrible price, The leadership is refusing to accept the new reality

T Priceless relic of their former wealth, Supplies vital to a budding industry, Resources once held lightly that now are very precious here

P Ill-maintained but splendid public building, Mansion marked by genteel poverty, Empty shop once catering to the rich
