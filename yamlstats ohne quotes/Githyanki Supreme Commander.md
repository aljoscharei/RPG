traits:
actions:
  - name: Multiattack
    desc: The githyanki makes two greatsword attacks.
  - name: Silver Greatsword
    desc: Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 17 (5d6) psychic damage. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the astral projection spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
bonus_actions:
reactions:
  - name: Parry
    desc: The githyanki adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the githyanki must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
legendary_actions:
  - name: Attack (2 Actions)
    desc: The githyanki makes a greatsword attack.
  - name: Command Ally
    desc: The githyanki targets one ally it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see or hear the githyanki, the target can make one melee weapon attack using its reaction and has advantage on the attack roll.
  - name: Teleport
    desc: The githyanki magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing and carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it. It also becomes insubstantial until the start of its next turn. While insubstantial, it can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is moved to the nearest unoccupied space.
spells:
  - The githyanki's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
  -   At will: mage hand (the hand is invisible)
  -   3/day each: jump, levitate (self only), misty step, nondetection (self only)
  -   1/day each: Bigby's hand, mass suggestion, plane shift, telekinesis
