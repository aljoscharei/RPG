  - name: Negative Energy Cone
    desc: The death tyrant's central eye emits an invisible, magical 150-foot cone of negative energy. At the start of each of its turns, the tyrant decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.  
             Any creature in that area can't regain hit points. Any humanoid that dies there becomes a zombie under the tyrant's command. The dead humanoid retains its place in the initiative order and animates at the start of its next turn, provided that its body hasn't been completely destroyed.

    desc: The targeted creature must succeed on a 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute.

  - name:
             9.  Disintegration Ray
    desc: If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.
