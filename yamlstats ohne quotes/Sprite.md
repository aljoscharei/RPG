    desc: Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 1 slashing damage.
  - name: Shortbow
    desc: Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
  - name: Heart Sight
    desc: The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.
  - name: Invisibility
    desc: The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.
