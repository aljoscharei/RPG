At 6th level, you can invest some of your faith into healing energies that do not incur any chance of Corruption to you. If you spend an action binding a wound, you restore one Hit Die to the treated creature. You can do this a number of times equal to twice your proficiency bonus and then must take an extended rest to recharge.
