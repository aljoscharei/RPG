# Armor 
Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.

[[Armor Proficiency]] 
[[Armor Class (AC)]]


**Stealth** If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

## Getting Into and Out of Armor 

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

**Don** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

**Doff** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

| Category      | Don        | Doff      |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Light Armor   | 1 minute   | 1 minute  |
| Medium Armor  | 5 minutes  | 1 minute  |
| Heavy Armor   | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shield        | 1 action   | 1 action  |
