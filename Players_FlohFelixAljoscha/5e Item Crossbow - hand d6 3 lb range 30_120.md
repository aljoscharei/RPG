 Crossbow, hand. Among the thieves and gangs of Yn- daros, a smaller and more easily concealed version of the crossbow is used. It can be held and fired in one hand, but requires two to load and has nearly the same punch as the standard crossbow. Assassins often apply poison to the bolts, making the weapon very effective for its size.
