6th-level transmutation ritual

Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Touch Components: V Duration: Special

You are able to lighten the spiritual burdens of a non- possessed, willing person; this is done by the sinner accept- ing to perform a task for the theurg on behalf of the Church. The task must be time-consuming, expensive, or dangerous (or perhaps a combination of these factors). Upon comple- tion of the task, the targetâ€™s permanent Corruption is reduced by 1d3 + 1.

If the target goes a month or more without making effort towards the task, the spell ends and the target gains one point of permanent Corruption for failing Prios.
