You became a captain not because you love war, or hate oppression, or even wish to profit from your own safety. But instead you are a true philosopher of war, one that observes and then acts with efficiency for its own sake. Your weapon becomes like your pen, a teacher in deeds, not words. And those that survive your lessons would do well to think on them.
