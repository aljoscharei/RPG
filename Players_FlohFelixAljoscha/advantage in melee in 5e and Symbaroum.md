[[advantage and disadvantage]]


Advantage

not like 5e: If a character has the advantage, it receives a +2 bonus to the relevant attribute when making Success tests, and its attacks deal +1D4 extra damage:

- Attacking an unaware, surprised target.
- All melee attacks against an enemy lying down.
- All melee attacks against a flanked enemy. A target is considered flanked if two enemies stand on opposite sides of it. It usually takes   a Movement Action to get around an enemy and flank it. In the same way a cha- racter can use a Movement Action to get away from a flanked position – but with the consequence of receiving a Free Attack from each ene- my engaged in melee.
- All attacks against enemies standing on lower ground than the attacker, such as attacking down from a wall against enemies climbing a ladder. This applies to both melee and ranged attacks.



Best ways to get advantage in Combat in 5e

-   rogues: hiding (as they can hide as bonus action)
-   barbarians: reckless attack (it’s a bread-and-butter class feature)
-   arcane spellcasters: faerie fire (a simple, low level, underestimated spell)
-   warlock: darkness + devil sight (this blocks field of view for party members though)
-   wizard / magic initiate feat: find familiar, having your familiar do the help action.
