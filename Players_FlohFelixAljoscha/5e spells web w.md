# Web 
_2nd-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20- foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.    

**If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. **
**A ball of web disappears!** or maybe it remains but is irrelevant


Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.    
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a **Dexterity saving throw**. On a failed save, the creature is [[202202102010 5e Conditions Restrained]] as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.    
A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.    



The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs (out of 64) exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
