# Levitate 
_2nd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a **[[constitution]]** saving throw is unaffected.    

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.    

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft. 

# Ruling: it should be a [[strength]] save, not con.  I envision strentgh as setting a minimal weight, so basically it is a save against the targets weight.  Sylphs blow from below like standing

Unlike other save-or-suck spells, Levitate doesn't allow for saves past the first save.  
Levitate becomes a save or die spell under the following conditions:  
-   The target has no or a weak ranged attack
-   They can't reach the ceiling nor the floor 20' away
-   They don't have a fly speed
If they fail their Con save then they float useless mid-air while the party deals with the rest of enemies. After that we have fun pelting it to death. Since most encounters often get done by round 5 or 6, that gives the whole party 5-4 rounds to focus down the target before the spell ends.  
On a Sorcerer twinning it, you dramatically affect the difficulty of an encounter with few foes in it.  
Am I missing something? Do most monsters have a ranged attack past level 7?

Well, it's concentration, so your wizard is half-nullified while holding them up in the air. But yeah, other than that there's no save beyond the initial one.  
That said, don't forget this bit: 
> If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move.

So if your move is more than the 20' the caster can move you, you're basically just exchanging an action with the caster as an action tax on both of you.


https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/140697/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-allowing-a-save-each-turn-against-the-levitate-spe


Consider the spell _[levitate](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Levitate#content)_ (2nd level), which allows the caster to lift a hostile creature off the ground and hold it in place. It is easy to make the comparison to spells like _[hold person](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hold%20Person#h-Hold%20Person)_ (2nd level) and _[hold monster](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hold%20Monster#h-Hold%20Monster)_ (5th level). While the hold spells paralyze the creature, _levitate_ prevents a creature from moving, and from making melee attacks.

My DM suggested that the target of _levitate_ be able to repeat the save every turn, as he felt that _levitate_ was too strong in comparison to _hold person_ and _hold monster_. Is this balanced?

# The _hold_ spells paralyse, _levitate_ does not

The main difference I can see between _hold person/monster_ and _levitate_ is that the former paralyses the target, whereas the latter only lifts the target upwards.

From _hold person_ (PHB, p.251):

> The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be **paralyzed** for the duration

And _hold monster_ (PHB, p. 251):

> The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be **paralyzed** for the duration

Compared with _levitate_ (PHB, p. 255):

> One creature of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration [Concentration, up to 10 minutes] ... An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

A creature affected by _levitate_ can still do many things, including making ranged attacks and casting their own spells that require saving throws, whereas someone who is paralysed can do nothing.

From the Paralyzed condition (PHB, p. 291):

> -   A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can't move or speak

From the Incapacitated condition (PHB, p. 290):

> -   An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.

Since a paralysed target is a sitting duck, it seems much more fair to allow them to make a saving throw each round to recover from this, since they have no other options; someone affected by _levitate_, on the other hand, can still do many things, just nothing that requires melee range or (depending on the room, since you can apparently move yourself around if you can "climb" along the walls/ceiling) movement.

So I'm concluding that, because the effects of _hold person/monster_ are more severe, the target "needs" to make a save each round more so than someone affected by _levitate_.

## Duration

The other consideration, however, is duration. _Hold person_ and _hold monster_ both last a minute, whereas _levitate_ lasts for 10 minutes. Therefore, if someone doesn't really have a lot of options (for example, if a melee-focused character who has, say, run out of javelins) is potentially stuck in the air for 10 minutes, that will take them out of the fight for longer than someone who is paralysed (if they have literally _no_ other options to contribute), although they will at least not be as vulnerable as someone paralysed (i.e. they can take the Dodge action, as Theik points out, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls against them, compared to the advantage and auto-crit imposed by the "paralyzed" condition).

That said, most combat doesn't last more than a few rounds, so in a typical combat, this will never be a concern. I'd still lean on the side of suggesting that allowing a saving throw each round for _levitate_ would weaken _levitate_.

## What about a Strength check rather than a Constitution save?

Another idea could be, rather than following the example of _hold person_, perhaps borrow from _entangle_ or similar? Being held in the air against your will, whilst it doesn't actually restrain you with regards to the "restrained" condition, does effectively restrain a melee-focused character. _Entangle_ restrains one or more creatures as per the "restrained" condition, and provides a different way to end that condition.

If someone affected by the _levitate_ spell were to be allowed to use their action to make a Strength check to break free of the caster's hold on them, this might be more balanced; they'd still have to burn an action, rather than getting a "free" saving throw, but it does still give a melee-focused character suspended in mid-air an option to do something about it.

For reference, here's _entangle_ (PHB, p. 268):

> A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell DC. On a success, it frees itself.

# It will ruin the innate balance of spells

Look at the two examples you've listed, hold person and levitate.

**Levitate:** When used as a hostile spell, if they fail their initial save, you're fairly capable of holding them there for ten minutes. They can still attack, they can still cast spells, they can still take the dodge action. You can take a melee-only opponent out of the fight, but that is it.

**Hold person:** You inflict paralyze on the opponent, one of the strongest effects in the game. They auto-fail on certain saves, they can't move, speak or act, any attack against them has advantage against them and any attack from within 5 feet is an automatic critical hit. This is huge; but the downside is that they get to save at the end of every round.

You are suggesting giving the only part where Hold Person is weaker to Levitate as well. If somebody can save against levitate after every round, why would anybody want to cast levitate instead of hold person?
