When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "[[5e Unseen Attackers and Targets]]" section later in this chapter.

	- ## How Does Hide Work?  
		- When you decide you want to hide, your DM first decides whether it’s reasonable that your character  could attempt to hide in this situation.  
		- Generally, this determination is based on how clearly enemies can see you. If the DM decides your character can try to hide, you then make a stealth roll. This roll must beat the passive perception of **all**  creatures you’re trying to hide from.  
		- The roll is also contested by perception rolls by any creatures that are actively searching for or focusing on your character.  If the stealth roll succeeds against all of these things, your character becomes hidden.  
		## Hiding in Combat and Hidden Combatants  
		You can try to hide in combat by using your action, on your turn. In the same way as when hiding outside  of combat, the DM first rules whether or not you could reasonably attempt to hide.  
		When you attempt to hide in combat, it’s usually assumed that all enemy combatants are actively paying attention to you so your stealth roll will usually be contested by perception rolls from all enemy  
		combatants.  
		It’s also assumed that all enemy combatants are paying attention to their surroundings so if, when you’re  
		hidden, you leave cover and openly approach an enemy, that enemy will generally spot you automatically  
		and without needing to make any perception rolls.
		
		Whether You’re In Ccover  
		This often is the most important factor. Usually, when you’re attempting to hide, you need to be behind cover. The degree of cover you need may vary based on other factors that obscure vision.  
		Some DMs may also be more or less lenient with cover requirements – some DMs prefer that your  
		character is behind full cover while some may allow you to hide behind partial cover.  
		For the purposes of hiding, it’s worth noting that cover only needs to obstruct vision and doesn’t need to provide ballistic cover.
		
		
		For example, light foliage won’t stop an arrow in flight but it will still obstruct an enemy’s vision of you. This means that some objects will provide a greater degree of cover when determining if you can hide  
		than they would when resolving attack rolls.  
		Simultaneously, a thick glass window might be more effective at deflecting arrows than at obstructing  
		vision.
		
		Rogues and Hiding  
		Rogues usually hide more than any other player characters. Rogues’ Cunning Action ability allows them  
		to hide (amongst other things) as a bonus action.  
		This is very powerful – other classes need to use their action if they want to hide which precludes  
		attacking, casting, or doing other useful things on that turn. This means rogues sacrifice a lot less when  
		they hide.  
		Rogues’ other abilities also synergize well with hiding. Attacking while unseen grants advantage on attack  
		rolls and rogues’ Sneak Attack ability grants extra damage when they attack with advantage
