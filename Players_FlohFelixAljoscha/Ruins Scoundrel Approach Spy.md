Already during The Great War there were secret agents working for the King and the court in Alberetor. After the war, the agency lay dormant until the recent troubling times made Queen Korinthia breathe life into what is called the Royal Sekretorium.

The Sekretorium consists of a number of reliable nobles who secretly enforce the Queen’s command to infiltrate various operations and hunt for sensitive information – or spread disinformation. The committee is led by high-borns, while the field work is carried out by nobles of lower rank. A vital part of the operations is aimed at Korinthia’s own allies within the Sun Church, Ordo Magica, the military and also the duchies of the realm, meaning the Queen’s close relatives. Some Spies are not equipped to handle the intrigues and moral ambiguities; others are cast out in the cold after incriminating failures. Former Spies of the Queen often live short lives, constantly on the run from both enemies and their former superiors.

Some other organizations surely have a few spies placed in Ambria, causing many people to be suspicious of converted barbarians, changelings, abducted humans who have returned, and other strangers.
