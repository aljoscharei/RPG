You are a noble Knight who fights to break the enemy’s lines or to hold your own. Heavily armored on the outside and with a deep sense of duty on the inside, you fight for the favor of your lord, the lives of your allies or your own family’s glory.
Maybe you dream of one day becoming a member of the Queen’s royal guard, the Pansars, or a Templar fighting in the name of Prios.
