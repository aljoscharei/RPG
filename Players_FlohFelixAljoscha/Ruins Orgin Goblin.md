LittLe is known about the origin of goblins, but their presence in the southern outskirts of Davokar is quite ob- vious. The tribe that left the darkness of Davokar to settle down close to Thistle Hold swarms and makes such a racket that they have made themselves quite unpopular among the town’s human populace. Their fiery temperament and strange ways of socializing have contributed to the disapproval: “Hide the Boot”, “Tame the Ogre”, “Trim the Thistle”, “Tighten the Temple” and “Want a Smack, Molok?” are party games that outsiders are reluctant to even watch.

The life of a goblin is short – a goblin is considered a youngster at the age of five, adult at ten and an elder at the age of twenty. To meet a thirty-year-old goblin is a rarity, as most of them voluntarily return to seek a lonesome death in Davokar before then. Meeting one who is forty is all but unheard of. The truth of the goblin life-cycle is even more remarkable, though few humans know it – when goblins feel the pull of the forest not all of them die. Some are changed, becoming trolls or ogres.

The only reason why goblins are tolerated in Thistle Hold is that they are practical when it comes to doing dirty work like draining marshes, emptying latrines and flailing about on scaffolding. Thanks to that, a gibbering horde of sinewy goblins flows into the town every morning to work hard at a number of heavy, dangerous or thankless tasks. Come nightfall, they are once again driven away, and a bunch of uncharacteristically silent goblins march back to their beds in simple huts of straw and clay.

Some goblins stray from this pattern, mainly treasure-hunters and goblins employed in the households of wealthy individuals in Thistle Hold. A dozen or so goblin younglings can also be found in the convent school in the capital city, where a handful of extremely patient monks have committed themselves to saving whatever soul resides inside the wild whelps. The most renowned goblin to represent both of these phenomena is Garm Wormwriggler, brought up at the convent school to later become a successful treasure-hunter.
