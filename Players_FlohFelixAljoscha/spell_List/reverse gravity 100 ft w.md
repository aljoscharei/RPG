# Reverse Gravity 
_7th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 100 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100- foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.    
If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.    
At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.  [[5e Falling]]



# Is 5E Reverse Gravity an undervalued spell?

"This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that arenâ€™t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall" PHB pg.272.

So for an seventh level spell, it has an impressive effect but its damage is underwhelming. If you have a high ceiling, you can remove melee enemies from the fight and smash them with falling damage twice (once when they go up, once when they come down) but it's quite situational and for a level 7 spell, it doesn't compare that well to many of the other things you could be doing with that spell slot.

That's until you stop looking at it from a purely mechanical damaging spell and focus on the first four words. "This spell reverses gravity". This isn't just flavor text, it's the effect of the spell. Casting this on ANY building will result in it's immediate destruction. Buildings simply aren't meant to be held upside down, they are designed with gravity in mind. The entire structure of the house 'collapses' upwards. Not just houses, but also walls, castles, keeps, gatehouses, bridges. None of these structures are glued to the ground, they all rely on gravity pressing them down into their foundations. Outside of magically constructed buildings designed with this in mind, nothing is safe from this spell. Most creatures trapped inside of these would be killed as the rubble crushes them.

Have I interpreted the effects of this spell correctly and this spell is a destructive beast or is there some part of architecture that I am misunderstanding?

This is pretty transparently not how the spell is intended to work. Without even considering the meaning of "objects not anchored in the ground in some way", let's compare to _disintegrate_, a spell that is only one spell level lower, and is a pretty classic 'anti-materiel' spell. Disintegrate, when striking a nonmagical Huge or larger structure/object, disintegrates a 10-foot cube. Your suggested interpretation would have _reverse gravity_ reduce a column of 50-foot radius and 100-foot height to rubble. Quick math puts that at 78500 cubic feet, or 785 times more volume destroyed than _disintegrate._

Further, in relation to the "spells do only what they say" vein, note that _earthquake_, an 8th-level spell, specifically lists its interactions with structures, and the mechanics/implications of their destruction (50 damage per round to the structure, 5d6 damage with Dex save to anything within half its height after reduced to 0). Not only does your interpretation perform the effects of _earthquake_ quicker/instantly but it also insta-kills things inside? It has a smaller effect radius than _earthquake_, but can target floating structures as well so I'd say that's a wash depending on your setting.

I'm all for using spells creatively to get more out of them, but this is pretty clearly outside the intended power budget for this spell (which is already pretty dang useful in a combat scenario).

You are forgetting the best use, ship combat, thats a fucking ton of water and the ship will float up, drowning them as they reach the top for a short time and flooding their boat, weapons and all sorts will fall out before it falls down, a boat would take immense damage.


Wouldn't the water flow outwards at the top thoughthough and fall back down like a fountain once it reaches the edge of the cylinder? Come to think of it, you could cast it next to their ship and it would suck up all of their nearby water as it goes up the cylinder. The ship would get sucked into it like an upside down maelstrom and then get launched back out.



I mean there would still be 50ft of water going up and back down at the top of the spell and if the boat is longer than the are then it will tear the boat parts apart, especislly if damaged, any crew would have to run to one part of the boat leaving them easy pray. What you said is also true, you could cast into the water to make a huge drop for the boat, this would for sure capsize it


It's more likely that it would flip the boat or simply carry it up, depending on the positioning of the boat within the spell. Think like a hydraulic ram that they use in special effects to flip cars in films.

Still a cool effect though!
