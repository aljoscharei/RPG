# Control Weather 
_8th-level transmutation_    

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** Self (5-mile radius)    
**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours 

You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don't have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.    
When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.    
When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.

This spell creates special weather conditions within a 12 hex radius of the caster. The effects will last as long as the caster concentrates. Effects are:
» Rain: All units fire missiles at -2 to attack throws. After three combat rounds, the ground will be turned into mud (p. 32), reducing movement by half. The reduced movement continues for the duration of the battle.
» Snow: All missile fire and magic is limited to 1 hex range. After three combat rounds, the ground will be turned into slush (mud, as above). The reduced movement continues for the duration of the battle.
» Fog: All missile fire and magic is limited to 1 hex range, and movement is reduced by half, while the fog is present.
» Clear: Clear weather cancels rain, fog, or snow, but not secondary effects such as mud.
» Intense Heat: Movement is reduced by half. Intense heat transforms mud caused by rain, snow, or transmute rock to mud into clear terrain.
» High Winds: No missile fire is possible, and movement is reduced by half, while the winds are present.
» Tornado: A Tornado unit under the caster’s control is placed on the map. It moves at 6 hexes per combat round in any direction within 12 hexes of caster, and attacks with HD 12, AT 1 Winds 2+. It cannot be hurt except by a dispel magic or control weather (clear) effect.
