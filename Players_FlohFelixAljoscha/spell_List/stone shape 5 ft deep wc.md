# Stone Shape 
_4th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.

Works well to make ladderlike handholds in a wall. Can give you enough stone to kneel behind for cover in a ranged fight. You can use it to make a very thin but continuous rock cover for a pit trap. Dam a small stream. Make a door unopenable by pinching the bottom with a stone floor. Make basic tools such as hammers, knives, and axes (obsidian counts as stone). Quickly make containers (bottle/bowl/vase/barrel). The spell can technically facet a gemstone without losing mass to the grinding process. It could also move all of the impurities in a gem to one edge that you could then grind off with regular lapidary tools.
