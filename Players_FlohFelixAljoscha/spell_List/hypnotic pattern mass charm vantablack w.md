# Hypnotic Pattern 
_3rd-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed [[202202102000 5e Conditions Charmed]] for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is [[202202102005 5e Conditions  Incapacitated]] and has a speed of 0.    
The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
