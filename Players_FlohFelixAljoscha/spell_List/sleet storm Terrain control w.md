# Sleet Storm 
_3rd-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is [[5e heavily obscured]], and exposed flames in the area are doused.    
The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it [[5e Difficult Terrain]]. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls [[prone]].    
If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.
