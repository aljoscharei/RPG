# Faerie Fire 
_1st-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.    
Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has [[advantage in melee in 5e and Symbaroum]] if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

As the Advantage also gives Scoundrela the opportunity to use **Backstab**, this should mean, that the target is distracted somehow. Painful? [[202202102106 5e Conditions Blinded]]?
