# Dimension Door 
_4th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 500 feet    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** Instantaneous Y

You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet."    
You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also bring **one** willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.    
If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.
