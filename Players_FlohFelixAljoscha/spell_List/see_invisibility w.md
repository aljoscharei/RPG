# See Invisibility 
_2nd-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver)    
**Duration:** 1 hour 

For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent. 

According to the rules, you can see the creature but you still have the disadvantage on attacks. This seems very weird.
