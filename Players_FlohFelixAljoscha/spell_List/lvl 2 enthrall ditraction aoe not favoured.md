# Enthrall 
_2nd-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** 1 minute 

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can't be [[202202102000 5e Conditions Charmed]] succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.

Enthrall is kind of a cool spell with some potential, but I’m not sure it packs enough punch to justify its place as a second level spell.

On the plus side, you can captivate a pretty big crowd of people, keeping their attention firmly fixed on you while your friends enjoy freedom and anonymity with whatever nefarious schemes you plotted beforehand.

The possible implications of this are huge. While you’ve got the crowd’s attention, your co-conspirators could rob a bank, rescue your ally who’s about to be hanged, or sneak into a party they weren’t invited to.

That sounds like pretty powerful stuff, right? So what’s the problem?

Every member of the crowd you’re trying to Enthrall gets to make a saving throw to avoid the effect. The odds of you effecting everyone in the crowd are pretty slim, meaning there will likely be a few people who will be able to spot what you’re up to.

And even if you do manage to captivate the whole crowd, the spell only lasts for a minute. That’s a pretty tight window to pull off a heist.

That’s not to say Enthrall can’t be useful for distracting smaller groups, or even a single NPC. But a [Charm Person](https://www.caverns-and-creatures.com/5e-spells/charm-person) spell would probably serve you better and last longer. The temptation to use Enthrall on larger crowds might get you into more trouble than not using it at all.
