# Programmed Illusion 
_6th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** 120 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)    
**Duration:** Until dispelled 

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.    
When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.    
The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.    
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

Can this illusion move around or is it stuck in the hex you create it on? :)

Personally I'd say yes; the spell only states that the illusory object/creature/phenomenon must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, but it can behave how you like.

To me that means you could set a trigger for enemies approaching within 30-feet of a cave entrance, causing a dragon to appear (just out of sight) then fly from the cave roaring and flying around in an arc like it's going to make a pass and return, hopefully scaring away the intruders who'll think they're about to be a dragon's dinner if they don't make themselves scarce.

Only restriction is the amount of time the illusion lasts, so something moving at a realistic speed can only travel so far, also the fact the illusion will be broken if it passes through something (though if you make it look like a ghost that might not be a problem). Also the trigger must be within 30-feet of the starting point, so no matter how far it can move it must start from and be triggered there.

What I love most is the fact that this spell's duration is "until dispelled"; my Bard tavern owner is 100% going to cast this every day to create annoying greeters outside the bar, chaining the trigger conditions together to bypass the 10-minute downtime (if the first casting is on cooldown, the second will trigger instead etc.).
