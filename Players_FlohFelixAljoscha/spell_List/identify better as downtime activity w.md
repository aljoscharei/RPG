# Identify 
_1st-level divination (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute. No: It should be a Downtime activity.
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.    
If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it. 


# In Ruins there is no Ifentify Spell. 
Identifying an Artifact is a Downtime Activity of Wizards and Artifact Crafters

At 3rd level you can attempt an Intelligence ([[5e Skills Investigation]]) check to determine the **properties of a magic item.** On a success, if it is a magic item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it. The DC is dependent on the kind of magic item: common (DC 10), uncommon (DC 13), rare (DC 16), very rare (DC 19), legendary (DC 22).

# If there is no identify spell, then how can you learn about magic items? 
[[Symbaroum Treasure MOC]]
- You have to go to a scholar.
	- But: How does the scholar know about an item, especially if the item was lost for milennia and there cannot be any information transfer.
- Maybe troll singers are the only way to reliably identify the object, because the trolls will always know what it is. Wizards can try by need a laboratory
- alternatively you can spend corruption to attune and the item will tell you.
