 5th­level Sorcerer conjuration (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 hour  
Range: 30 ft.  
Components: V, S, M (burning incense for Ire Sylph, soft clay for Gobble Gnome, sulfur and phosphorus for

Hungry Fury, or water and sand for Choking Undine) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour*

You call forth a dark elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. The dark elemental appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a Hunger Fury emerges from a bonfire, and a Gobble Gnome rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental,  
it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can’t  
be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

* If the caster sacrifices a Small or larger creature as part of the casting process then the duration becomes ‘until dispelled’.
