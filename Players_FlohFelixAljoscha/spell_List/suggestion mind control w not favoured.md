# Suggestion
_2nd-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours 

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.    
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.    
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.    
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends. 

The target does not know a spell was cast: [[casting a spell#Targets]]. BUT: Unless you have the [[sorcerer#Subtle Spell]] feature, the target will remember the muttering arcene ullulations even if the actions still appear reasonable. Surrounding enemies will tell the target that it was the caster who suggested a weird course of action.

	- # YES.

	- **Is the sentence of suggestion in the suggestion spell  the verbal component, or is the verbal component separate?** Verbal components are mystic words ([[5e players handbook]], 203), not normal speech. [[casting a spell#Verbal (V)]] The spell’s suggestion is an intelligible utterance that is separate from the verbal component. The command spell is the simplest example of this principle. The utterance of the verbal component is separate from, and precedes, any verbal utterance that would bring about the spell’s effect.

	- **If a sorcerer casts a spell with only verbal or somatic components using Subtle Spell, can an opponent use counterspell against it?** If a spell that’s altered by Subtle Spell has no material component, then it’s impossible for anyone to perceive the spell being cast. So, since you can’t see the casting, counterspell is of no use.
