# Creation 
_5th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)    
**Duration:** Special 

You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell [[Appendix B Planes of existence#^edbd3d]]  to create a nonliving object of **vegetable** matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create **mineral** objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.    
The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. 

| Material              | Duration   |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Vegetable matter      | 1 day      |        
| Stone or crystal      | 12 hours   |           
| Precious metals       | 1 hour     |         
| Gems                  | 10 minutes |             
| Adamantine or mithral | 1 minute   |           

Using any material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.
