# Blight 
_4th-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** 30 feet   
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a **Constitution saving throw**. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.    
If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.    
If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th. 


It competes with Dimension Door, Banishment... and Polymorph, and Greater Invisibility, and Freedom of Movement, and Wall of Fire, and Conjure Woodland Beings...

The thing is, damage is rarely the best use for a spell. Fireball, at least, is an AoE, so it has the use of clearing out large group of weak enemies. But 8D8 damage of a fairly commonly resisted damage type on a single enemy isn't going to turn a fight around. Not as hard as simply taking said enemy out of the fight entirely with Banishment or turning an ally into a giant ape, at least.

We just got 7th level, and my friend said that Blight is a bad spell. When I asked why they said they just heard it somewhere. What I'm wanting to know is that is the spell really that bad?

For a 4th level spell, 8d8 damage isn't that bad right? That's a higher average and maximum than Fireball! It is a constitution save, but they still take half damage on a success. Most creatures at this level are not plants. However, in the chance there is a plant, you instakill the creature as just a nice bonus. My only guess is that it's competing with spells like Dimension Door or Banishment. Also the caveat of no undead or constructs might hurt, but we mostly face humanoids in our campaign.

Because there's a belief that spell-casters are most effective by providing control effects.

Dealing damage is the one thing martials are better at than spell-casters. So a) you should let them do that and b) you should do something they can't (which is battlefield control).

From that perspective, it's not that Blight is a bad damage spell. It's that damage spells are "bad".

Big AoE effects are an exception to that, which is why Fireball usually get's a pass (and it's overtuned on purpose).

8d8 damage is on average 36 damage on a single target. That's damage that a decently built martial character at 7th level can put out in one turn. Why would 7th level caster use their highest level spell slot to do this? If you hit two targets with a 3rd level fireball, you outdamage blight easily. Simply put, doing 36 damage on average isn't enough of an impact for a 4th level spell slot.

Con saves are usually the worst to target. On average, con saves are the highest on enemies. And then there are also two creature types completely immune to this. So on top of not being a very impactful spell, it's also not very reliable.

There's some really powerful fourth levels spells. For example: Conjure woodland beings, evard's black tentacles, dimension door, greater invisibility, banishment and polymorph. Any of these will easily have more of an impact than blight will.

Barbarian

I suppose because, unlike Fireball, and unlike all other 4th level spells, it only deals damage to a single target, _and_ it has no additional affects.

I tried looking for a 4th level spell that just dealt damage, but I couldn't find any. All other spells deal less damage, yeah, but it's either AOE, comes with an additional useful effect, or both.

If you need damage, it's good, even though CON is the highest ability score on average in D&D, but most of the time you're going to want that AOE or those additional effects.

Warlock

We can compare it to Hellish Rebuke for warlocks.

Cast at 4th level it deals 5d10 = 27.5 damage compared to Blight's 8d8 = 36.

Hellish Rebuke is a reaction, however, so it functionally deals higher damage equal to the Warlock's regular attack. Using Eldritch Blast that grants an additional 2d10 = 11 worth of damage, bringing the total to 38.5 damage, 2.5 higher than _Blight_. This difference becomes even more severe if you account for Constitution being a strong save, and if the Warlock takes Agonizing Blast.

---

For a Wizard you can compare it to _Ice Storm_ which does 2d8 less damage but is an AoE and provides area control.

1.  It’s not AOE, so the thing about not hurting undead and constructs is a limitation.
    
2.  It’s not that it’s a bad spell on its own, it’s that other level ~~7~~ 4 spells are better.
