This spell kills some or all of the creatures in one unit within 12 hexes of the caster. Roll 4d8 for the number of Hit Dice affected by the spell. Divide this total by the Unit HD of the targeted unit to determine the number of creatures killed. Calculate the ratio of the number of creatures killed to the original number of creatures in the unit, and apply an equivalent percentage of damage to the unitâ€™s uhp (based on its starting uhp). If the unit makes a successful a saving throw versus Death, it avoids the effect.

This spell will kill a total of 4d8 Hit Dice of creatures in a 30' radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within the range limit). If there are more Hit Dice of creatures present than the spell can kill, the death spell will slay the weakest creatures first. Hit dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Each creature affected is allowed a saving throw versus Death; those that fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or more Hit Dice or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters, golems, and any other creature that is not truly alive.

## Does it instantly kill PCs without death saves? YES
They would instantly die, with no saving throws. However, at this level, players are assumed to have access to means of resurrection, so this isn't as devastating as it would be at earlier levels.
