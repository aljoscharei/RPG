# Plant Growth 
_3rd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action or 8 hours    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.    
If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.    
You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.    
If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

This spell creates a 1 hex growth of impenetrable forest (p. 31) that blocks line of sight. It may be placed anywhere within 6 hexes of the caster. If placed on top of an enemy unit, the unit may not move or attack until the growth is destroyed, unless it is a Flyer or otherwise could bypass the obstacle. A cloudkill, dispel magic, fireball, wall of flame, or similar effect will destroy the growth. This spell can be cast before battle during set-up provided the casterâ€™s army was not surprised.

This spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become thick and overgrown. The dimensions of the growth are determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 3,000 square feet (a 30' x 100' area or equivalent). The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that is impassable to creatures of less than giant size. Such creatures may hack their way through the thicket at no more than 5' per round. Giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal movement rate. The area must have brush and/or trees in it for this spell to take effect.

The reverse form, shrink plants, may be used to render overgrown areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal version.

Growth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered, either by the opposite form or by dispel magic. This spell has no effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.
