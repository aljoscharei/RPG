# Rope Trick 
_2nd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)    
**Duration:** 1 hour 

You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.    
The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.    
Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5- foot window centered on the rope.    
Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.

<ol>
<li>In a situation where your party canâ€™t be seen? Use rope trick 
and hide from sight and still be able to see and listen into what is 
going on in a room.</li>
<li>Your party needs to get to a spot 60 or less
 feet up in the air? Use rope trick and have a rope that can climb to 
any spot in an elevated position</li>
<li>Need a safe place for your 
party to heal in combat? You guessed it, rope trick allows pesky dragon 
breaths and fireballs to not be able to hit the party or NPCs who are in
 need of healing or protection.</li>
 <li>Falling to your doom (like 500+ feet free falling)? Rope trick to stop your descent and give you an hour to fix the situation.</li>
 <li>Room filling up with poison or water and you need more time? What do you 
know! Rope trick for the win by going into an extradimensional space 
that is filled with clean fresh air.</li>
<li>Want tactical cover in an empty room? Create a space for you to hide in with rope trick.</li>
<li>Trying to hide questionably gotten goods? Then a small rope trick can be a 
perfect way to hide the items off your person if being inspected.</li>
<li>Need to securely hold someone or something in place? Tie it up with rope and let the rope trick hold them there. (Great for interrogations over 
cliffs)</li><li>Looking for a way to hide from those with detect magic, locate objects, or any other divination spells? Hop into your rope  trick, pull the rope up and be immune to divination effects that require you on the same plane of existence.</li>
<li>Need a safe place to do a short rest? Use the spell as intended and have a safe place to rest!</li>
</ol>


<p>Teleportation spells are great emergency spells as they often remove 
an item or person from a situation too dangerous for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big downside to these spells is most are too high in their spell level or take too long to cast to use reliably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, having a second level spell that will remove you from an 
area in a non permanent way is a perfect way to give your character 
enough time to build a permanent escape route, or remove themselves from
 an imminent threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this way, rope trick is a great emergency spell to giving a character more time to remove themselves from a threat.</p>
<p>A few common examples of threats rope trick circumvents is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Divination spells as they target creatures on the same plane.</li>
<li>Dragon breaths and other AOE attacks.</li>
<li>About to be discovered by something that would kill you or severely harm you.</li>
<li>Unknown Traps where something bad is about to happen.</li>
<li>Surprise situations where the floor is lava or gone.</li>
</ol>



<p>Again, while not all applications of avoiding a threat. This should 
get your brain thinking of what your caster can do when they can at will
 remove themselves from the material plane, or remove themselves from 
situations that can cause damage. For that reason, Rope Trick, has 
become a staple in my caster classes as a great way to give my party 
time to adapt and adjust to dangerous encounters.</p>
