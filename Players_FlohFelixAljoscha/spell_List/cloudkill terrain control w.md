**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground.

#### Cloudkill:
[[cloudkill terrain control w]]
This spell creates a cloud of poison in a hex adjacent to the caster. The cloud slowly moves away from the caster; roll 1d6 during the caster’s command phase each round, and on a roll of 1-2, the cloud moves 1 hex. Any unit or character struck by cloudkill must make a saving throw versus Poison each combat round it is in the cloud. If it fails, it is destroyed. Even if the unit or character survives, it must retreat (p. 23) from the hex towards its own map edge. A unit or character which cannot retreat from the hex is destroyed. Units and officers of more than 5 HD are immune to cloudkill. The spell lasts the duration of the battle or until dispelled.

| Range:    | special
| :-------- | :------------
| Arcane    | 5
| Duration: | 6 turns

This spell creates a cloud of poison gas 30' in diameter that spreads out from the caster's fingertips. The cloud moves at a rate of 20' per round away from the caster. The poison gas is heavier than air and will sink down holes or slide downhill; it is broken up by trees or thick vegetation. Each round they are within the cloud, creatures of fewer than 5 Hit Dice or levels must save versus Poison or die, taking 1 point of damage even if the save is successful. Creatures having 5 or more Hit Dice or levels take 1 point of damage each round they are within the cloud. The cloud persists for the entire duration even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it.

# Cloudkill
**Duration:** 6 turns

**Range:** 30’

A poisonous fog streams from the caster’s fingertips, filling a 30’ diameter area.

-   **Movement:** The fog moves at 60’ per turn (20’ per round), driven by the wind (or away from the caster, in still conditions).
-   **Sinking:** Because the fog is heavier than air, it sinks to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings.
-   **Damage:** All creatures in contact with the vapours suffer 1 hit point of damage per round of contact.
-   **Creatures with less than 5 Hit Dice:** Must also save versus death (once per round of contact) or die.
