# Hallucinatory Terrain 
_4th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** 300 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)    
**Duration:** 24 hours 

You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.    
The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

The caster creates a 1 hex illusionary terrain piece of the caster’s choice. It may be placed up to 12 hexes away from the caster. The spell lasts until the hallucinatory terrain is touched by a unit or until dispelled. This spell can be cast before battle during set-up, provided the caster’s army was not surprised.

This spell makes an area of outdoor terrain appear as a different type (e.g. field into forest, grassland into desert, or the like). The entire terrain feature must be within range of the spell. This spell requires a full turn to cast.

The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort of natural terrain. A save versus Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the creatures or characters affected actively attempt to do so. The spell lasts until the illusion is touched by an intelligent creature moving into the hallucinatory terrain.
