# Stinking Cloud 
_3rd-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 90 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is [[5e heavily obscured]]. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.    
Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.    
A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

This spell creates a cloud of foul-smelling vapors in a hex adjacent to the caster. A unit within the affected hex must make a successful saving throw versus Poison or be helpless due to nausea. The unit remains helpless for 1d4+1 rounds +1 round per level of the caster. If the unit succeeds on its saving throw, it immediately retreats one hex towards its own map edge. If it cannot retreat, it is helpless. A helpless unit cannot be activated. The stinking cloud blocks line of sight into or through the affected hex.
