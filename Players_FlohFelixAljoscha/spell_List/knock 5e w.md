# Knock 
_2nd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.    
A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.    
If you choose a target that is held shut with [[arcane_lock w]], that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.    
**When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.**
