# Passwall 
_5th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)    
**Duration:** 1 hour 

A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening's dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.    
When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.

This spell creates a small hole in a wall or other stone obstruction. A unit may pass through the hole at a cost of 1 additional hex of movement. The passwall lasts for the duration of the battle, or until dispelled.

This spell creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is up to 10' deep. If the wall's thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends (due to duration, dispel magic, or caster's choice), the hole closes; creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.
