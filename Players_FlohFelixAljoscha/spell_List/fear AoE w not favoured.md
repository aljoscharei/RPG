# Fear 
_3rd-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:**Self (30-foot cone)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot [[AoE Cone]] must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become [[5e Conditions Frightened]] for the duration.    
While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the [[202202101902 5e Actions in Combat Dash]] action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

This spell affects any one unit within 1 hex of the caster. The unit must make a saving throw versus Spells; if it fails, it immediately becomes disordered (if not already), changes its facing towards its own battlemap edge, and retreats 1 hex. Thereafter, at the start of the morale phase of each combat round, the unit must retreat a number of hexes equal to its hustling movement rate towards the friendly map edge. This continues until the effect is dispelled, the unit leaves the battlemap, or 30 combat rounds have elapsed. The unit may not be activated while the spell is in effect.
