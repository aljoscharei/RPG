Casting Time: 1 action Range: 10 feet Components: S Duration: Instantaneous

With this spell the caster can heal those already tainted by darkness, though at a danger of gaining more Corruption. For each willing creature within range (including the caster), roll 1d4 plus your spellcasting modifier. If the result is equal to or lower than their permanent Corruption then they recover hit points equal to the result. If it is higher than their permanent Corruption then they gain the difference in temporary Corruption.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 3rd level or higher, you add 1 to your result for each level above 2nd.
