In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While in this raging state, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll. The bonus damage is 1 + half of your proficiency bonus, rounded down.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slash- ing damage.
- If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while in a rage.
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have used your rage a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you must finish a long or extended rest before you can use this feature again.
