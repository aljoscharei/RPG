# Delayed Blast Fireball 
_7th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    
The spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.    
If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.    
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.

Mechanics and My Thoughts

DBF acts as a _fireball_ at every moment until the time at which it reaches its destination. Then the fun begins.

For ten rounds (or one minute), the spell may be concentrated upon to increase the final damage by 1d6 per round. This gives a total of 22d6 fire damage should it be maintained for the full duration, making it the third-highest damage spell behind _disintegrate_ and _meteor swarm._

However, this damage comes at a significant opportunity cost, requiring Concentration for the full period the caster wants the spell maintained. Once Concentration fails, the spell explodes.

Interestingly, DBF can be plucked and thrown from its position by a dextrous character. With a bit of luck, an agile person can hurl the fireball up to 40 feet from its existing position, at which point it will explode.

Personally, I find this spell rather lacking from a player's perspective. It has a very niche use case, and is functionally the same as a _fireball_ when cast from a 7th-level spell slot and allowed to detonate quickly. I can see this spell seeing use if you have a lot of 3rd level spells you want, but not a lot of 7th level spells, and you want a more versatile _fireball_ that won't crimp your spell limit. Otherwise, there are a dozen spells that would find a better home in your 7th-level slot.

Sorcerers shouldn't take this spell. Wizards may take it, but only if they hit a windfall and want to splurge.

From a _Dungeon Master's_ perspective, however...

DM's Toolkit

_Delayed blast fireball_ is the ultimate revenge-ambush spell. The spell has essentially no use case relevant to aggressors, but to a defender who needs a getaway there's no better distraction than 22d6 fire damage from a small glowing bead.

The example in the passage I wrote above is where _delayed blast fireball_ shines. If you know someone powerful is coming, and you're a powerful wizard, and you don't have enough time to raise minions, DBF is the perfect tool for gaining the upper hand on your enemies.

_"It is my professional opinion that wizards of a social bent, whose charisma and charm endear them to the populace and ingratiate them with the elite, always refrain from viewing the results of a_ delayed blast fireball._"_ - Kelgore




The one time I saw this spell used, it was one of the greatest setups I have ever seen at a table. We were escaping a dungeon being pursued by a Beholder and several frost giant minions. Two of the characters had been turned to stone and the rest of the party were forced to carry them (literally) out of harms way and were slowed to half our walking speed. We found a bottleneck room where we had removed all the traps, at which point the wizard told us to go on ahead without him. After a wasted turn arguing, we left him alone in the room and ran our butts to safety.

When the giants entered the room they found him standing calm and ready with his staff. The giants parted, the beholder hovering in past them - at which point he smiled and said something like "I get to go out with a bang!"

He had cast Delayed Fireball when he heard the giants trying to bust down the door and stood in front of it - masking most of the light and the Beholder's anti-magic cone.





I once had a fun fight where I had the enemy put a delayed blast fireball on top of the chained up hostage sister of one of my players (the enemy was also an evil half sister of his.. it was a ride) and it was such a fun little defense, because if the party attacked the her they would risk her losing concentration and killing the good sister. Great tension right there.

Of course things never go as planned because the monk ran up in one turn (as they do) and punched the evil sister in the face until her concentration broke and killed the good sister anyway. She (the monk) was not very good at listening to the plans of the entire group.

Epilogue: The good sister was resurrected on the scene and the evil sister was killed.




The wizard in my party and I have come to call ourselves the fireball delivery squad. We sneak into a room, he casts the bead next to me, and then my 22 dex rogue (Got one of those fancy books) picks up the bead and throws it. The wizard leaves the room in case I screw up the check and then I'll just use evasion to mitigate or ignore the damage if it happens. We've done it 4 times and I've yet to fumble my save to pick it up.
