### Adjudicating Areas of Effect
 [[D&D5E-DMG Dungeon Master's Guide.pdf]] p 249
 
Many spells and other game features create areas of effect, such as the cone and the sphere. If you’re not using miniatures or another visual aid, it can sometimes be difficult to determine who’s in an area of effect and who isn’t. The easiest way to address such uncertainty is to go with your gut and make a call.

If you would like more guidance, consider using the Targets in Areas of Effect table. To use the table, imagine which combatants are near one another, and let the table guide you in determining the number of those combatants that are caught in an area of effect. Add or subtract targets based on how bunched up the potential targets are. Consider rolling 1d3 to determine the amount to add or subtract.

Targets in Areas of Effect
| Area             | Number of Targets      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Cone             | Size ÷ 10 (round up)   |
| Cube or square   | Size ÷ 5 (round up)    |
| Cylinder         | Radius ÷ 5 (round up)  |
| Line             | Length ÷ 30 (round up) |
| Sphere or circle | Radius ÷ 5 (round up)  |

For example, if a wizard directs [burning hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands) (a 15-foot cone) at a nearby group of [orcs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16972-orc), you could use the table and say that two orcs are targeted (15 ÷ 10 = 1.5, rounded up to 2). Similarly, a sorcerer could launch a [lightning bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt) (100-foot line) at some [ogres](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16969-ogre) and [hobgoblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16925-hobgoblin), and you could use the table to say four of the monsters are targeted (100 ÷ 30 = 3.33, rounded up to 4).

This approach aims at simplicity instead of spatial precision. If you prefer more tactical nuance, consider using miniatures.

	- ## Markdown Map Syntax
	```
	- These one-dimensional text-based battle maps use the following [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-based syntax:
	- Player characters are _italicized_ by wrapping them in underscores "_".
	- Locations are **bolded** with a pair of asterisks "**".
	- Three dashes (---) represent distance between groups or locations. Each set of dashes represents a distance of around 15 to 30 feet; generally the distance a character can move on a turn. Each additional set of dashes is another 15 to 30 feet, another move.
	- Creatures within one location are generally considered within 5 to 10 feet of one another. They can generally move around within the location without taking an opportunity attack but may take an opportunity attack if moving to another location.
	- Groups of monsters can be represented with "Nx" before their name where N is the number of monsters (example 6x Kobolds).
	- Damage inflicted to one monster or a group can be denoted with a number at the end of the monster's name (One-eyed gnoll 7). We can account for hordes this way by removing one monster from the group when the damage is equal to the hit points of a single monster in the group (14x skeletons 7).
	- Status effects can be put at the front of a creature's name like "S" for sleep, "P" for prone, or "H" for hypnotized. You don't need a full key for this, just use the first letter of the effect and people will figure it out. You can also just write out the effect like "(Sleep)" or "(Hypnotized)".
