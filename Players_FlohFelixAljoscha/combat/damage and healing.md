description: Rules for tracking damage, death and healing from the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).

# Damage and Healing 
Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a **_fireball_** spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures. 

## Hit Points 
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points. 

## Damage Rolls 
Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a **weapon**, **you add your ability modifier--the same modifier used for the attack roll--to the damage.** A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts **_fireball_** or a cleric casts **_flame strike_**, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

### Damage Types 
Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

[[5e Damage Type Acid]] **Acid.** The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

[[5e Damage Type bludgeoning]] **Bludgeoning.** Blunt force attacks--hammers, falling, constriction, and the like--deal bludgeoning damage.

[[5e Damage Type Cold]] **Cold.** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.

[[5e Damage Type Fire]] **Fire.** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

[[5e Damage Type Force]] **Force.** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including **_magic missile_** and **_spiritual weapon_**.

[[5e Damage Type Lightning]] **Lightning.** A **_lightning bolt_** spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.

[[5e Damage Type Necrotic]] **Necrotic.** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as **_chill touch_**, withers matter and even the soul.

[[5e Damage Type piercing]] **Piercing.** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.

[[5e Damage Type Poison]] **Poison.** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.

[[5e Damage Type Psychic]] **Psychic.** Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage.

[[5e Damage Type Radiant]] **Radiant.** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's **_flame strike_** spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

[[5e Damage Type slashing]] **Slashing.** Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.

[[5e Damage Type Thunder]] **Thunder.** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the **_thunderwave spell_**, deals thunder damage. 

## Damage Resistance and Vulnerability 
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters. 

## Healing 
Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points, and magical methods such as a **_cure wounds_** spell or a **potion of healing** can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.

A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the **_revivify_** spell has restored it to life.

## Knocking a Creature Out 
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable. 

## Temporary Hit Points 
Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.

Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.
