# Acid Arrow 
_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder’s stomach)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

> On the surface, Acid Arrow is your standard damage dealing spell. 4d4 points of damage isn’t too shabby for a second level spell, but it’s nothing to sing songs about either. It’s also nice that you can do at least a little bit of damage even if you miss.
> What separates Acid Arrow from other similar spells, however, is the delayed damage.
> How can we leverage that to our advantage? There are a few different ways I can think of off the top of my head.
> Use it to break enemy spellcasters’ **concentration**. Even if they maintain it the first time, you’ve got one more bite at the apple even if you choose a different target with your next turn.
> Take one last shot at enemies who are running away. Just when they think they’re free and clear, their face melts off. Joke’s on them!
> If you’re only a hit point or two away from being taken out of the fight, you might take some satisfaction in knowing you’re going to get one last attack in after you fall unconscious or die.
> It’s also worth noting that the spell description doesn’t say that you need to target creatures with this spell. Use it to dissolve a rope, ruin a painting, or polish your silverware.
