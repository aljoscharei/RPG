Reddit says
From what I gather, Create or Destroy Water is really only useful in 3 niche situations:

1.  You need fresh water
2.  You need to put out a fire
3.  You need to clear fog
    

Am I missing something? Are there other creative uses for this spell I don’t see?
A source for water for shape water. Flooding trap mechanisms. Can be turned into holy water.
If it's cold enough or you have a way to lower the temperature you can use it to freeze/break locks.

Soak gunpowder so it won't explode. Ruin letters so they can't be read.
If you wanna be petty, make it rain on people you don't like. Break into the jerk mayor's house and soak his bed.

It's a first level spell that counters another 1st level spell (Fog Cloud) and also makes it so you'll never die of thirst in the desert.

That's plenty of power for that level and it doesn't need to be any more useful than that.


In general, water is a fantastic heat transfer liquid due to its high specific heat. Pour it on something frozen and it can help thaw it. Pour it on something hot to cool it off.

Cavitation is another feature. Destroy a chunk of water and it causes the other fluids to have to fill it in.

Gathering up particles of minerals or such. Basically, water can take particles in either solution or suspension, and is even called the universal solvent. You could pour out the water over a floor and scrub to gather up the particles, then load up the water in a container and destroy it, leaving the particles behind to sift through.


Source of water for plants that might otherwise wilt and die due to adverse conditions.

If the temperature is below freezing, the DM could rule that the falling rain turns to ice when it contacts the surface, making the area inside the 30 foot cube become difficult terrain.

Drop it on a fire elemental.


For the small price of this low level spell slot, you too can “Save a Locathah”. Donate today. Another Locathah dies every 4 hours. Your small contribution will make a huge difference.


Your ship was attacked and there is too much water to get to the leak to patch it up. Destroy Water upcasted to get rid of enough for your party to rush to the source of the leak and start fixing it.

Sure, other spells could be better, but the question is if you know the spells or have them prepared. While sailing you likely will have _'Create or Destroy Water'_ prepared for both fresh water if you somehow run out and to deal with fog.

You can use it in combat to create difficult terrain by making the ground wet and slick or muddy. You can use the weight of the water to hold something in place (for example, you could throw a prisoner into a pit, cover it, put a barrel on the cover, and fill the barrel with water -- 10 gallons of water weighs more than 80 lbs). If you've got Mold Earth as well you can create an instant mini-moat at high level.

By destroying water you could counteract all of those effects.


Create water at the crotch of an NPC you don’t like to make it look like they pissed themself.

- Ask your dm if you’re allowed to create water or food inside an enemy’s gear. Could force a flying creature to take off their armour if it’s too wet or slow them down. If they’re really generous, cast a wind based spell and give them a cold.
- Couldn't you use this spell to destroy the water inside of a living thing and insta-kill them?
	- It specifies open container, you would have to talk to your DM but honestly that's super game breaking as a level 1 spell. I wouldn't advise it, your DM will probably say no, and it would just make you a boring op spellcaster.
