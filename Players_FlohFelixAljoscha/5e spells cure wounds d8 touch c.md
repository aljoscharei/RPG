| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Duration: | instantaneous

With this spell the caster heals 1d6+1 points of damage by laying his hand upon the injured creature. This spell may also be used to cure paralysis, but does not then cure any points of damage. The spell will never increase a creature's hit points beyond the normal amount.

The reverse form of this spell, cause light wounds, causes 1d6+1 damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack throw is required in this case.

Undead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by cure light wounds and healed by cause light wounds.


[[ACKS Chapter 05 Spells#Cure Serious Wounds]]

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | instantaneous

This spell works exactly like cure light wounds, save that it heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. The reverse, cause serious wounds, also works exactly like cause light wounds, except that it inflicts 2d6 + caster level in damage.
