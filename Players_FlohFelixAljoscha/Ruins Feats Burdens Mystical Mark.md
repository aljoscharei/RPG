â€¢ Bonus: +2 to Charisma  
You have a mystical mark somewhere on your body, maybe a birthmark or a scar gained later in life, that requires effort to conceal. Whatever the origin, you are at risk of being mistaken for having a blight-mark. In situations when it is relevant, you must pass an opposed Charisma (Deception) versus Wisdom (Perception) roll or attract unwanted attention (which can take different forms depending on the situation).
