# Ruins of Symbaroum

A long rest requires around eight hours, six of which must be spent sleeping and the other two in light activity, such as being on watch, reading, or conversing with others. You gain the following benefits when you complete a long rest: 
- You recover hit points equal to the maximum value of your Hit Die (e.g. 8 for 1d8) plus your Constitution modifier. This does not count as using a Hit Die.  
- You reduce your temporary [[Ruins of Symbaroum Corruption]] by **twice your proficiency bonus**.  
- You can spend one or more Hit Dice to recover hit points, up to the characterâ€™s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to your level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. You regain spent Hit Dice upon finishing an extended rest, as explained below.
- You can spend a Hit Die in order to reduce your temporary Corruption by your proficiency bonus again. You can continue to do this as long as you have Hit Dice to spend and temporary Corruption to reduce.

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity--at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity--the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

Stan Shinn:
LONG REST (8 Hours) : Around 8 hours, no more than 2 hours on watch. Need at least 1 HP to take long rest. Only once per 24 hours. At end of rest, regain all hit points and half of your maximum number of Hit Dice.  
Not in rules but clarifed by the designers: Elves cannot use their Trance to get the beneft

of long rest in 4 hours instead of 8; they still need 8 hours rest (they simply spend only 4 of it zonked out.).

At 1st level, if you take a long rest, you regain 1 HD back (despite rounding down of .5 = 0).
