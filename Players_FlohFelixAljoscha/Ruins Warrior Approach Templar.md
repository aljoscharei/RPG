The church of Prios and its representatives are protected by the Knights of the Dying Sun, heavily armed and with the fire of faith burning behind their breastplates. The power of faith makes the armor of the sun knights harder than steel. Their mere presence repels abominations by the sheer radiance of their conviction or by weapons burning with Prios’ holy rage.

Lately, a schism is said to have grown between the commander of the Templars and the Church’s Curia in Tem- plewall. Initially, the dispute was about how to handle the ancient sun temple found close to Karvosti, but apparently there are other ideological differences between the Knights of the Dying Sun and the Sun Church in general. What will come of this conflict is not easily guessed; some dismiss it as a natural effect of the Church’s development, others whisper of a possible division of the Church, in line with the conflicting views that exist regarding the dying Prios and humanity’s role in the drama.
