• Prerequisite:You have taken the Sorcerer approach and attained at least 7th level in the mystic class.  
Beyond the world  or between worlds, if one believes in the existence of multiple worlds – lays the Yonderworld. In the Yonderworld soul-eating creatures roam, indistinguishable from abominations to the common man. Sorcerers appreciate the likeness, but call them “daemons” in acknowledgment of their differing origins. The daemons can be forced, lured or invited into the physical world by those who know of passages between the worlds.

You learn the following ritual: summon daemon. You gain only 1 permanent Corruption for this ritual and do not gain Corruption when you cast it at the basic option (see page 206).


- The History of Demonology
	- Many demonologists regard their trade as vastly different from that of other sorcerers. In essence, they see themselves as explorers, seekers of the truth, and as more advanced compared to mossy Wizards who are satisfied poking around in the soil of the “Here-and-Now.” Sadly, they will likely never gain the admiration and respect they think they deserve.
	- According to many legends, the demonologists of the past invited Corruption into the world, precisely because they were scratching and tearing at the world’s fabric. Later stories blame them for having destroyed the once so lush realm of the Dark Lords, Lyastra. If anything, the demonologists will always be seen as the worst kind of sorcerers.
