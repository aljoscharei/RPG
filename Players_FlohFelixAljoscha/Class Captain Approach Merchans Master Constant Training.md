Constant Training

At 3rd level, you have resolved that the folks you surround yourself with should benefit from consistent training. Choose a number of pupils up to your proficiency bonus. As long as you shared their last extended rest with them, you can use your bonus action to remind them of their lessons.
Each pupil has advantage on any attack rolls they make before your next turn. You must take a short (or longer) rest before using this feature again.
