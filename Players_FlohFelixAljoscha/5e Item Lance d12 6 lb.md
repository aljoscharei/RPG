Lance. The value of this weapon should not be underesti- mated â€“ the largest monstrosities of the Dark Lords were often slain by lances in the hands of brave knights. The weapon was also used by the Ambrian cavalry to gain dominance over the lowlands and drive barbarians, packs of predators and abominations into the forest of Davokar.
