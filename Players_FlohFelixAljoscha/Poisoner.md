At 6th level, you become bold enough to try your hand at the arts of poison. While taking a short or long rest, you can prepare a weapon with a poisonous coating. Make a DC 15 Intelligence ([[Poisoners kit 2 lb 50 gp]]) check and compare it to below:

- If you succeed by 5 or more, the weapon adds 1d6 poison damage to any successful strike and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw vs 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus or become poisoned for one minute.
- If you score a normal success, you can choose one of the above effects but not both.
- If you fail by four or less, the creature must makea Constitution saving throw as above, but the Poisoned effect lasts only until the end of its next turn and it takes no damage.
- If you fail by five or more the poison has no effect.
In any case, the poison lasts only until your next rest, at which time you must either reapply it or go without.

At 13th level the poison damage rises to 3d6. At 17th level, the poison damage rises to 5d6.
