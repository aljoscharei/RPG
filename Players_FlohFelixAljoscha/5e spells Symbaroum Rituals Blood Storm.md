# Blood storm

8th-level [[conjuration spells]]
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: Self  
Components: V, S, M (a few drops of your own blood) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a raging storm of blood 150 feet in diameter, with yourself and any nearby allies and enemies within the eye of the storm, a 15-foot radius, remaining unharmed.

The storm heavily obscures [[5e heavily obscured]] the area and those caught in the storm are blinded [[202202102106 5e Conditions Blinded]] . In order to take an action, they must first succeed at a Wisdom saving throw. On a success they are able to act this turn.

The blood storm also has a drowning effect; it actively aims for the mouth and nose. If a creature starts its turn in the storm, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d6 necrotic damage on a failed save or half that on a successful one. The only way to avoid the effect is to leave the storm’s area of effect, move into the eye area, or find a structure that can be completely closed off from the storm’s effects.

On your turn, you can use a bonus action to move the cloud up to 10 feet in a direction that you choose.
