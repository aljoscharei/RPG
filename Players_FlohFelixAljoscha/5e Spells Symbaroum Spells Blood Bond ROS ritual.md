Res and 1xp to heal d4 corruption and cause d6 corruption in familiar


BLooD BonD*

2nd-level transmutation (ritual)

Casting Time: 10 minutes  
Range: Touch  
Components: V, S, M (two fine silver chains, one for the

caster and one for the familiar, 50 thaler total) Duration: Until dispelled

You magically link yourself to your familiar to an even greater degree, allowing you to share the burden of Corruption between the two of you. The familiar’s Corruption Threshold becomes equal to 2, plus any positive Charisma modifier. When you receive temporary or permanent Corruption you may direct all or part of it to your familiar.

If the familiar’s permanent Corruption becomes equal to or higher than its Threshold, it becomes a blight-born (maybe spirit) creature and abandons the caster, possibly attacking them as it escapes.
