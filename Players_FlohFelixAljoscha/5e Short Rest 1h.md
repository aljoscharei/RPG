Short rests require one hour of light effort, no more than sitting and talking, tending to wounds and the like. You gain the following benefits when you complete a short rest:  
- You can spend one or more Hit Dice to recover hit points, up to the characterâ€™s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to your level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. You regain spent Hit Dice upon finishing an extended rest, as explained below.
- You reduce your temporary Corruption by your proficiency bonus.
- You can spend a Hit Die in order to reduce your tempo- rary Corruption by your proficiency bonus again. You can continue to do this as long as you have Hit Dice to spend and temporary Corruption to reduce.
