This spell will remove all spell effects on any one unit, or one terrain spell effect (such as hallucinatory terrain) within 6 hexes of the caster. It may fail to remove spell effects of casters of a higher level; a proficiency throw on 1d20 of 1 + 1 per level of difference is required.

The caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within a cubic area 20' on a side. The caster must choose whether to cast dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.

If dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spells and spell-like effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect cast by a character of equal or lower level than the dispel magic caster's level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell or effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a 20% chance of failure.

Some spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically includes any magical disease, geas, quest, petrification from a flesh to stone spell, and any curse, including those created by bestow curse (the reverse of remove curse) as well as by cursed items.
