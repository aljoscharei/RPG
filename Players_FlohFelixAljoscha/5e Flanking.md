If you regularly use miniatures, flanking gives combatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack rolls against a common enemy.

A creature can’t flank an enemy that it can’t see. A creature also can’t flank while it is [[202202102005 5e Conditions  Incapacitated]] . A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking.

**_Flanking on Squares._** When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy.

When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures’ spaces. If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, the enemy is flanked.

**_Flanking on Hexes._** When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on attack rolls against that enemy. On hexes, count around the enemy from one creature to its ally. Against a Medium or smaller creature, the allies flank if there are 2 hexes between them. Against a Large creature, the allies flank if there are 4 hexes between them. Against a Huge creature, they must have 5 hexes between them. Against a Gargantuan creature, they must have at least 6 hexes between them.

#### Optional Rule: Diagonals

The [[201810162210 5e Player's Handbook]] presents a simple method for counting movement and measuring range on a grid: count every square as 5 feet, even if you’re moving diagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws of geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This optional rule provides more realism, but it requires more effort during combat.

When measuring range or moving diagonally on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you’re counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. For example, a character might move one square diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight (15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total movement of 30 feet.

ranged Attacks dont benefit from flanking.

-   The clear implication is that flanking only comes into play when 
 using miniatures on a battlemat. If you’re playing “theater of the mind,” 
there’s no way to adjudicate flanking, so the rule doesn’t apply and the advantage can’t be claimed.
-   You can’t use flanking advantage to negate disadvantage from attacking an unseen enemy.
-   “A creature can’t flank while it’s incapacitated” seems like a silly rule, since you can’t _attack_ if you’re incapacitated, but the important implication is that your _ally_ also has to be capable of taking actions to divide your enemy’s attention. Otherwise, your ally isn’t helping you flank—he or she is merely turning one space into difficult terrain.
-   It’s not enough to attack an enemy from the _side_ for flanking advantage to apply: you must attack from _behind_. (I’m imputing a concept of facing that technically doesn’t exist in D&D 5E, but you know what I mean.) The four-hex gap for Large creatures on a hex map is odd, because four hexes around in one direction is only three in the other. I’m not sure why the authors didn’t just go with three.
-   Flanking applies to melee attackers only. I assume this is because fending off a melee combatant is a very _active_ process, whereas whether a ranged attack hits you or not depends much more on your attacker than it does on you. (The hex-map rule omits the specific mention of melee attacks, and this omission isn’t corrected in the _DMG_ errata, but I assume it still holds. It’s certainly implied by the adjacency requirement, and as a dungeon master, I wouldn’t allow a player to argue that he or she could use the advantage gained from flanking to negate the disadvantage from shooting at point-blank range.)
