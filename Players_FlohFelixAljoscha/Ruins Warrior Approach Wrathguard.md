The High Chieftain of Karvosti is guarded by a select number of warriors in the Guard of the Slumbering Wrath. Anyone who has met a Wrathguard in combat knows that there is nothing drowsy about them. On the contrary, the blood of a Wrathguard boils with fighting spirit, and the Huldra teaches them to use that passion effectively. To damage a Wrathguard is to wake their fury; to badly hurt an experienced guard is like summoning a furious aboar in human shrouding.

Every clan sends their nine most skilled warriors to Karvosti to become members of the Wrathguard. Nominations are made by the clanchieftains when one of their representatives falls in combat or – in singular cases – retires. He or she who is appointed can hardly say no, partly because the mission is regarded as one of the most honorable a clan warrior can be tasked with, partly because a rejection likely would mean exclusion from the clan or see the warrior branded as an outlaw. There are tales of barbarians who have been appointed to the Wrathguard after having left their clans, and therefore refused to serve. But it is also said that the defiance of these defectors always ends up costing them their lives, sooner or later...
