Outlaw

Not every captain fights on behalf of their higher-ups. An Outlaw has broken free from their society and now dis- obeys its laws. Human Outlaws, either from the barbarians or Ambrians, are often concerned with those their society has left behind. Others, like elves, dwarves or trolls may have strained at their limitations and decided on plotting their own way forward. Outlaws focus on stealth and ranged weaponry to even the odds and remain free.
