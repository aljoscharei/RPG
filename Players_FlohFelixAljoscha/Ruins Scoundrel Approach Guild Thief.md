The Guild Thief has a long, if not proud, tradition rooted in Alberetor, a tradition that emerged stronger after the relocation to the north. Each of Ambria’s towns has at least one Thieves’ Guild, larger ones often have one based in each district or block.

Not just anyone is qualified to be a Guild Thief. Sure, pick-pockets and simplistic thugs may prove to be suitable recruits but only the most cunning and agile can hope to gain membership in the Guild. To strike unnoticed and know who is untouchable are matters of principle to the Guild Thief.
