[[movement and position#^e6771a]]

- A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage. 


PRONE: Dropping prone is a free action. Standing from prone costs half movement speed.

MOVEMENT WHILE PRONE: Crawling costs an extra feet of speed per foot moved (1 foot movement costs 2 feet). Crawling through difcult terrain costs an additional foot of speed (1 foot movement costs 3 feet).

Alternative explanation:
Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of
movement.
