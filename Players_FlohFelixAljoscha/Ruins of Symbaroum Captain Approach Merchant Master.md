These captains are those who have taken the lessons of military life and applied them to ordinary affairs, especially mercantile concerns. After all, a merchant caravan in the wild is in almost as much danger as a scouting party along the front lines. Many merchant masters lead expeditions paid for by [[future shares]].
Some of the benefits from this approach provide equipment to the party members. These benefits are considered to be paid for by the trading efforts of the group that mostly happen “off-screen”. Also, if a character loses an item that the merchant master gave them for whatever reason its loss should be temporary and its replacement automatic and at no cost to the character.
