You light incense and choose a 10-foot cube within range. The smoke spreads among those present and gathers around objects and creatures in relation to how corrupted they are: the closer the smoke gathers, the more tainted the creature in question is. The Gamemaster clearly states if objects or creatures are blight-stricken, blightmarked or thoroughly corrupt. (See Corruption, page 38).

Holy smoke can be countered by the exchange shadow spell.
