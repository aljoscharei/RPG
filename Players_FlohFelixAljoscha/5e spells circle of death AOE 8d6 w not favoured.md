The Forums say:
A 60' radius spell hits _over four hundred 5x5 squares_. (Technically, it hits 452 squares, but I'm allowing for all the inefficiencies and "must cover at least 50%" rules which cause a decent amount of loss at the edges.) Compare that to a _fireball_, which covers an ideal area of 50ish squares. Are there a lot of situations where you _need_ 8x-9x the area of a Fireball spell? Probably not. But I can at least see some benefit for stomping on such a large area.  
  
**Circle of Death, really, is a bad guy spell.** For commoners and guardsmen, having only 1-3 HD apiece, 28 damage pretty much IS death. So what if it's sub par for most nasties PCs will face? It's GREAT for a cackling madboy wizard delighting in the suffering of innocents.  
  
That said, it also has _some_ uses in dealing with a huge enemy onslaught. Remember that 5e expects you to continue using CR 1, 1/2, or even 1/4 creatures at 12th level and beyond; for many such creatures, while this spell might not be instant death or even a killing blow, it'll hurt like hell and just one more hit will take out a lot of things (and at this point, Fighters are getting a third attack, and most other melee classes hit extra hard with theirs, so they're quite good at this sort of 'cleanup').
