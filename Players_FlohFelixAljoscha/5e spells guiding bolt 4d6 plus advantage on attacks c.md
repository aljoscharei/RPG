1st-level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S Duration: 1 round

A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the tar- get. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical light glittering on the target until then.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.

As the Advantage also gives Scoundrela the opportunity to use **Backstab**, this should mean, that the target is distracted somehow. Maybe with the religious aspect, the target is distracted by a feeling of guilt, by attracting bad luck or distracting environment like insects.
[[faerie fire 60 ft adv for attacks on creat d]] also gives advantage
