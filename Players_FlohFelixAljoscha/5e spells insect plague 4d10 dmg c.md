# Insect Plague 
_5th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 300 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere's area is difficult terrain.    
When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

[[202208070936 ACKS Domains at War Battles#Insect Plague]]
This spell creates a swarm of insects 1 hex in size within 12 hexes of the caster. The swarm may slowly move under the caster’s control; roll 1d6 during the caster’s activation each round, and on a roll of 1-2, the swarm may move 1 hex. The swarm blocks line of sight. Any units of less than 3 HD that are contacted by the swarm take 1 uhp of damage and automatically retreat 1 hex (regardless of battle line, morale, or other modifiers). The swarm cannot move through walls of fire, and is destroyed by sleep, dispel magic, flame strike, or fireball. The spell lasts while the caster concentrates.

| Duration: | 1 day |

This spell summons a vast cloud of swarming insects (usually locusts) consisting of 4 insect [swarms](Chapter08%20Monsters.md#swarm) (as described in the Monsters chapter). Each swarm is 30' x 30' in size and possesses 4 Hit Dice. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). The caster may summon the swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area, and the whole plague will obscure vision and automatically drive off creatures of less than 3 Hit Dice. The caster must concentrate for the duration of the spell to maintain control over the insect plague. The caster loses control of it if he is successfully attacked or if the insect plague leaves the range of the caster. While the caster has control over the insect plague, he can move its constituent swarms 20' per round. The swarms are stationary once the caster loses control of the insect plague.
