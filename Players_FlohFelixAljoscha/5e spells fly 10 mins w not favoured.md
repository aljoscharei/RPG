The subject of this spell can fly in any direction at a speed of up to 120' per round (360' per turn). Flying under the effect of this spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can  attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell cannot carry aloft more weight than his maximum load. If a fly spell is dispelled, the subject will plummet from the air.
