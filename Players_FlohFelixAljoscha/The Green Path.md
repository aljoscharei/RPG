These features interact with nature itself.  
- Forest Trails. You can find or create trails in Davokar or wherever you go that make travel easier. You and a number of companions equal to your proficiency bonus have advantage on saving throws against Exhaustion due to travel.
- Shapeshifter. You can use your action to magically assume the shape of a natural beast you have seen before. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before you have to take a short or longer rest to regain your expended uses. Your mystic level determines the type of beast you can transform into, see the table below.
- Natureâ€™s Lullaby. By singing softly and focusing on a particular abomination that can hear you, you and your companions can pass by it without it reacting you are essentially invisible to the blighted creature. If anyone acts aggressively or you stop singing (to cast a spell, for example) the benefit ends. You can make use of this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and then must take a long or extended rest before using this feature again.
