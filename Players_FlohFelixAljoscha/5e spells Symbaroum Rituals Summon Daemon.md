suMMon DaeMon

3rd-level conjuration (ritual)

Casting Time: 10 minutes  
Range: Self  
Components: V, S, M (candles, dagger and golden bowl) Duration: Special

You summon an abomination from the Yonderworld, a dae- mon. The creature resists your control and you must make a contested Charisma check to keep it under your control. If you fail and the daemon was not summoned into an inverted magic circle, the daemon is free to do as it likes (including at- tacking you or your allies) and is free to roam until it chooses to return to the Yonderworld (which it can do as an action) or it is destroyed. If it is trapped in an inverted magic circle it instead cannot move and returns to the Yonderworld  at the end of the magic circleâ€™s duration. You can talk to the daemon during this time, but it is under no compulsion to speak or to give you truthful answers.

If you succeed at the Charisma check then the daemon is under your control for 24 hours. If requested, it will return to the Yonderworld, which ends your control of it. It will also carry out your orders, unless they involve a clear danger to the daemon from the servants of Prios or another god. It takes its own turn and follows your commands.

When you cast this spell, you summon a Servant Daemon. If you choose to gain a point of permanent Corruption you can instead summon a Vindictive Daemon, for two points of permanent Corruption you can summon a Knowledge Daemon or for three points of permanent Corruption you can summon a Guardian Daemon. The stats for the daemons are included below.
