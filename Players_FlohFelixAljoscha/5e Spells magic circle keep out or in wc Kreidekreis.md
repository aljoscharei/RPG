**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

* The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
* Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature. [[202202102000 5e Conditions Charmed]], [[5e Conditions Frightened]], possession: [[ghost#^8d6295]] [[magic jar possess w]]

The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica
Each chapter of Ordo Magica has a permanent teleportation circle and these are more or less always manned by a bored and/or studying novice, making it possible to always reach the chapter telepathically. Telepathy is the transmission of direct thought, with no opportunity for subtlety or dissembling, so wizards are generally reluctant to overuse telepathic communication, especially with mystics they do not know very well. Even with trusted colleagues, transmissions are kept as short as possible – on the crowded career ladder of Ordo Magica there is no room to give even a close friend any competitive advantage, if you can avoid it.
