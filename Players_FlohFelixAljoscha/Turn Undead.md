Atou can use the power of the Lawgiver to rebuke the undying. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead within 30 feet of you that can see and/or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. 
[[turned undead]]
You can perform this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to take a long or extended rest.

only [[Ruins of Symbaroum Mystic Approach Theurg]]: 
At 9th level, any affected undead with a challenge rating equal to or lower than half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) are destroyed instead of turned. Player characters of the undead origin do not have a challenge rating and cannot be destroyed by this feature, though they can be turned.
