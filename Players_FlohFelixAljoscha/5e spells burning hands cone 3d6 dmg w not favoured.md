# Burning Hands 
_1st-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** Self (15-foot cone)   
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone [[AoE Cone]] must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    
The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1s
