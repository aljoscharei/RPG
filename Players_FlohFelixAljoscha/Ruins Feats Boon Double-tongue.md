Double-tongue is a language developed by the Thieves Guild in Yndaros – you say one thing but mean another. This way, sensitive conversations can be held within earshot of out- siders. If multiple characters know Double-tongue, they can speak about secrets without risk – provided that the bystanders do not know the language as well...
