At 6th level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. [[5e Long Jump]] You also have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.
