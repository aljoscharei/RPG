taLe of ashes

2nd-level divination (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: Touch  
Components: V, S, M (the ashes of the object) Duration: Instantaneous

This spell allows a mystic to read the ashes of a burnt object and thereby discern what the object once was and what happened when it burned â€“ the mystic experiences all impressions from the fire, sees who was there and hears what was being said. A campfire can have much to tell about what happened around it.
