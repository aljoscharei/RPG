• Prerequisite: You have taken the Theurg approach and attained at least 11th level in the mystic class. You cannot take both the Confessor and Inquisitor feats.  
For some theurgs, whether among priests or Black Cloaks, the hatred of the dark is so strong that they choose the in- quisitor’s road: to seek out and destroy the enemies of Prios. Inquisitors are happy to cooperate with Templars and other members of the Church; they are not interested in understanding the darkness and tend to rely on cunning, ambushes and assassination to reach their goals, never brute force like the Templars. To most inquisitors, sorcerers and their followers have no right to exist, and for that reason no moral consideration is necessary when they are fighting the dark.

You learn the following rituals: [[5e spells Symbaroum Rituals Holy Smoke ROS ritual]], [[5e spells Symbaroum Spells Anathema]], [[5e spells Symbaroum Spells Purgatory]]. You gain only 3 permanent Corruption for these rituals and do not gain any Corruption when you cast them.
