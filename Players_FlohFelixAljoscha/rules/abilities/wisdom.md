description: Information on the Wisdom ability from the 5th Edition (5e) System Reference Document (SRD)

# Wisdom 
Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition. 

## Wisdom Checks
A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someoneâ€™s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

**Other Wisdom Checks.** The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

* Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow 
* Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead 

## Spellcasting Ability 
Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
