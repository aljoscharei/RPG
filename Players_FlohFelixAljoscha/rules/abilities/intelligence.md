description: Information on the Intelligence ability from the 5th Edition (5e) System Reference Document (SRD)

# Intelligence 
Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason. 

## Intelligence Checks 
An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

**Other Intelligence Checks.** The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following: 

* Communicate with a creature without using words
* Estimate the value of a precious item
* Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
* Forge a document
* Recall lore about a craft or trade
* Win a game of skill

## Spellcasting Ability 
Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
