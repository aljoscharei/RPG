corruption

Power corrupts, and in Ruins of Symbaroum this is quite literally true. A fundamental principle is that when nature is cultivated or violated it grows dark and vengeful – and strikes back! The darkness that comes alive in this way feeds off and can continue to infect its surroundings. Since Mystics bend and warp nature according to their will, they are constantly threatened by Corruption. This principle is mirrored in the concept of Shadows and in creatures like abominations and the undead.

Corruption starts at 0 and increases from there. Most Corruption gathered is temporary, your character struggles against a dark foe, or uses non-permanent magic and their Shadow temporarily grows darker. However, sometimes you will gain permanent Corruption, usually by taking up a pow- erful magical item or by exceeding your Corruption Threshold.

For non-Mystic characters, your Corruption Threshold is equal to the total of twice your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier, as the influence of a darkening Shadow makes most people gloomy and morose. So the formula is:

Corruption Threshold = ([your proficiency bonus × 2] + your Charisma modifier), minimum 2.

During the course of the game, you will gain temporary Corruption. You might also start with a certain amount of permanent Corruption, due to your equipment or mishaps in the past. Your starting 
 orruption value can never be lower than your permanent Corruption score.

If your total Corruption (temporary plus permanent) exceeds your Corruption Threshold, you must make a Corruption check, to see if you can bear so much darkness. Roll a d20. If the result is equal to or less than the amount by which your current Corruption exceeds your Threshold, you will gain a mark of Corruption. Roll 1d20 on the [[Mark of Corruption Table]]. The mark fades 24 hours after your total Corruption drops below your Corruption Threshold.

example: Mira’s ogre mystic Grumpa has been casting sev- eral spells in a desperate bid to escape some unwise hunters. Grumpa’s Corruption Threshold is 7 and Mira’s last casting brings her current Corruption to 10. 10 (current Corruption) minus 7 (Corruption threshold) equals 3. She rolls a d20 and if the result is 3 or lower, Grumpa will gain a mark of Corruption.

You only make a roll when you gain new Corruption and that new Corruption exceeds your Threshold. If you receive the same mark of Corruption twice then it can either intensify or your GM can choose another result for you.

Corruption and Shadow

As you gain Corruption, your Shadow changes. Temporary Corruption darkens the Shadow, muting any color that it once possessed. The category listing in the table below indicates how the theurgs of Prios would judge a person’s Shadow, based on their holy smoke ritual (see page 195). Permanent Corruption affects it in the following ways:

- Permanent Corruption 1 point or more: Blight-stricken. Visible to those who can see Shadows as black spots moving within the Shadow.
- At half your Threshold or higher: Blight-marked. Your Shadow is covered with darkness, causing great concern for those who can see it.
- Beyond your Threshold: Thoroughly Corrupt = Blight-Born. Your Shadow becomes completely black and your character must become a NPC as you are overwhelmed by the burdens you bear.
