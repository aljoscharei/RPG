description: Rules for resting and recovering from the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).

# Resting 
Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest--time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day. 



## [[5e Short Rest 1h ]]
## [[5e Long Rest 8h]] 
## [[Ruins Extended Rest 24h]]

## [[Rest variant Gritty Realism short 8h long 7d]]
