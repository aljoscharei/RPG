description: Rules for managing movement and travel from the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).

# Movement 
Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope--all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.

The GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day." Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: "After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch."

Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over. 

## Speed 
Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day. 

### Travel Pace 
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.

**Forced March.** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.

**Mounts and Vehicles.** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a _carpet of flying_, allow you to travel more swiftly.

| Pace   | Distance per Minute | Distance per Hour | Distance per day | Effect                                           |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fast   | 400 feet            | 4 miles           | 30 miles         | -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores |
| Normal | 300 feet            | 3 miles           | 24 miles         | -                                                |
| Slow   | 200 feet            | 2 miles           | 18 miles         | Able to use stealth                              |

### ADVANCED RULE - EXPEDITION SPEED
https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46101/roleplaying-games/5e-hexcrawl-part-2-wilderness-travel

An expedition’s speed is based on the walking speed of its slowest member.

-   In 1 hour at normal pace, the expedition can travel a number of miles equal to its speed divided by 10.
-   At a fast pace, the expedition can travel 150% of its normal speed.
-   At a slow pace, the expedition can travel two-thirds of its normal speed.
-   At an exploration pace, the expedition can travel one-half of its normal speed.
-   Calculate distance per watch based on the expedition’s hourly speed.

On the tables below, distances have been rounded to the nearest half mile.

**EXPEDITION SPEED – PER HOUR**

| **Walking Speed** | **Fast Pace** | **Normal Pace** | **Slow Pace** | **Exploration Pace** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20 ft. | 3 miles | 2 miles | 1.5 miles | 1 mile |
| 25 ft. | 4 miles | 2.5 miles | 2 miles | 1.5 miles |
| 30 ft. | 4.5 miles | 3 miles | 2 miles | 1.5 miles |
| 40 ft. | 6 miles | 4 miles | 3 miles | 2 miles |
| 60 ft. | 9 miles | 6 miles | 4 miles | 3 miles |
| 100 ft. | 15 miles | 10 miles | 7 miles | 5 miles |
| 300 ft. | 45 miles | 30 miles | 20 miles | 15 miles |

**EXPEDITION SPEED – PER  4-hour WATCH**

| **Walking Speed** | **Fast Pace** | **Normal Pace** | **Slow Pace** | **Exploration Pace** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20 ft. | 12 miles | 8 miles | 5.5 miles | 4 miles |
| 25 ft. | 15 miles | 10 miles | 7 miles | 5 miles |
| 30 ft. | 18 miles | 12 miles | 8 miles | 6 miles |
| 40 ft. | 24 miles | 16 miles | 11 miles | 8 miles |
| 60 ft. | 36 miles | 24 miles | 16 miles | 12 miles |
| 100 ft. | 60 miles | 40 miles | 27 miles | 20 miles |
| 300 ft. | 180 miles | 120 miles | 80 miles | 60 miles |

> _Note: You might also choose to generally use the basic travel distance for expeditions, but use the advanced rules for expedition speed for unusual means of conveyance (via magic, mechanism, or fantastical mount, for example)._

###[[5e Difficult Terrain]] 


## Special Types of Movement 
Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go. 

### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling 
While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check. 

### Jumping 

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.
