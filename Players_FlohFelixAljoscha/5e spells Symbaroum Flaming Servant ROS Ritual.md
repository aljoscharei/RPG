[[Ruins of Symbaroum Wizard Spells]]

You summon a creature of living fire to occupy a suit of armor that you provide. The summoned creature remains within 30 feet of you at all times and follows your commands. It shares your initiative count and you can use your bonus action to command it to take an action, such as attack a target. It can suppress its fiery nature to interact with objects normally or you can command it to use its action to set unattended flammable objects alight. If it is destroyed then you cannot summon the creature again until the next day.
