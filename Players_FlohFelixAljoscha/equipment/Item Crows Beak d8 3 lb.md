Crow’s Beak. A less elegant, but still effective weapon is

the crow’s beak, also known as a Kandorian war pick af- ter the city in Alberetor where it was first forged. The crow’s beak is a club whose metal head is fitted with a spike or a beak of steel, in order to punch through armor more easily. After the escape to Yndaros, the smiths of the Kandorian war pick settled down in the district of Old Kadizar where they have continued to craft their dreaded weapons.
