Skald’s Cuirass. Troll singers are often warrior poets and many wear a flexible armor of woven cloth- or leather- strips, strengthened with protective harmonies. The Skald’s Cuirass is durable without hampering the wear- ers’ movement, making it popular among other groups as well. For instance, wealthy duelists in Yndaros often color their cuirasses in personal colors, so that they can be recognized from afar.
