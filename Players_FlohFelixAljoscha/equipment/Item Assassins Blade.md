Assassinâ€™s Blade. The slender grip and the feather-thin steel of the blade makes this weapon easy to conceal without sacrificing its bite. It is easily strapped to the wrist or ankle, or even attached behind the neck with a lump of resin. Special girdles or hidden pockets in clothes work just as well. The weapon can be smuggled past guards, to be used on secret missions or to be handed over to a prisoner.
