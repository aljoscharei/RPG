[[Equipment]]

the peoples of the Davokar region possess a vast knowledge of how to transform herbs, fruits and the bodily organs of animals into useful elixirs. Among the barbarians it is usually the witches who create the elixirs, while Ambrian decoctions are often made b y specialized craftsmen and artisans.

The exchange of knowledge between alchemists in Ambria and Davokar causes ever more elixirs to become available to the Ambrians. Some drugs can only be purchased on the black market in places like Thistle Hold, since they are illegal or at least so inappropriate that selling (or buying) them will at- tract attention from the authorities and witch hunters. Among these are most elixirs that give Corruption; both Ambrians and barbarians handle the trade in such decoctions discreetly.

Finding a specific elixir on the black market in Ambria requires a **DC 13 Charisma check by someone who has con- tacts in the black market (most Scoundrels, some Hunters or anyone with the Unusual Contacts feat)**. Alternatively, someone with Alchemist’s Supplies can brew elixirs in civ- ilization; if they also have a Field Laboratory they can do so in the wilderness. Supplies cost half the market value of the elixir or require 1 downtime day of gathering.

The table below gives the DC to produce the elixir. If the elixir provides a numerical effect this is also given. A slash (/) indicates a choice between effects, which will be explained in the elixir’s entry below. Consuming an elixir is usually an object interaction, but the GM may require an action instead, depending on the location of the elixir and external factors. The chart also provides an average sale cost and likely number of elixirs available.
