Chain Staff. The chain staff was developed by elves and has been adopted by some barbarian clans. The weapon is composed of a staff with a short chain attached to each end, making it possible to use the weapon to ensnare a

target. The chains often end in a weight or a short blade,

making it even more deadly.
