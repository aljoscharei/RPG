Fighting Style

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You canâ€™t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Archery: 
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

### Defense: 
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Dueling: 
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

### Great Weapon Fighting: 
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Polearm Fighting: 
When wielding a reach weapon, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on a melee attack roll within your reach. You have to wield the weapon two-handed

### Shield Fighting: 
If you make a successful melee attack roll you can use your bonus action to slam a target within 5 ft with your shield. If the target is your size or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw against 10 plus your Strength (Athletics) modifier. On a failure you can choose to move the creature 10 feet in a line, or cause it to become prone.

### Snare Fighting:
If using a weapon with the ensnaring prop- erty and you make a successful attack roll, you can spend a bonus action to forgo do- ing damage, instead tripping the target and causing it to fall prone. This only works on creatures your size or smaller with two or less legs, or similarly shaped targets.

### Two-Weapon Fighting:
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
