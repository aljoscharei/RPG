# Chain Lightning
_6th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; and three silver pins)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as **three** other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.    
A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for each slot level above 6th.
