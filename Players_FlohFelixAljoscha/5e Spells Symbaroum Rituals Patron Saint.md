Casting Time: 10 minutes  
Range: 120 ft.  
Components: V, S (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 thaler)
Duration: Special

You summon a guardian spirit to aid you, the soul of a fallen Templar that has been given the honorable mission to once again serve one of the Sun Godâ€™s chosen. The martyr mani- fests as a being of light. It is normally invisible, but begins to shine when danger is close.

In non-combat situations, the spirit serves as your assistant. Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant 
 erforms the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. The spirit will never venture more than 120 feet away from you. If it is somehow prevented from remaining within that dis- tance of you, it is dispelled when the distance between the two of you exceeds the range of the spell.

In combat, the spirit becomes a glowing figure with a flail made out of light and a halo above its head. Use the following statblock for the spirit, it acts independently. If slain, the spirit is dispelled. The spirit counts as a member of your group, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.
