## Vanilla 5e

A character needs **one pound of food per day** and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero. 

## symbaroum:
For people traveling through Davokar, running out of food or water is as serious a threat as predators and corrupted nature. After five days without any food whatsoever, two days without water, or **ten days on rations**, the following effects kick in:
- For each additional day, the character gains a level of exhaustion. 
- The character cannot begin to recover exhaustion until they take a long rest and also eat and drink something

> **Food**: Small or Medium creatures require 1 ration of food per day. They can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) before suffering 1 exhaustion level per day thereafter. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.
> 
> A creature on half rations counts as going a ½ day without food (and these half days accumulate until they can eat full rations).
> 
> **Water**: Small or Medium creatures require 1 gallon of water per day, or twice that in hot weather. A creature on a half ration of water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution check at the end of each day or suffer a level of exhaustion. If they drink less water than that, they suffer a level of exhaustion automatically. If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels instead of one level in either case.
> 
> Waterskins hold a half-ration of water. [[5e Items Waterskin if full 5 lb 2 sp]]
> 
> **Recovery**: Any exhaustion suffered from lack of food or water cannot be removed until after a full day of normal consumption.
> 
> **Large & Tiny Creatures**: Tiny creatures require one-quarter ration of food and water per day. Large creatures (like horses) require four rations  of food and water per day.
