_1st-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 90 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into [[5e Difficult Terrain]].    
A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [[202202102010 5e Conditions Restrained]] by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.    
When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away. 

**there must conceivably be seeds in the ground.**
