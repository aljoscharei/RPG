Drawing from the force of wrath you can infuse an ene- myâ€™s body with larvae that then start to eat their way out. Although it is loudly refuted by members of the court, per- sistent rumors say that this is how the hero king Ynedar met his demise.

On a successful melee spell attack, the victim is in- fected with larvae. At the end of its turn, it suffers 1d4 piercing damage. On the next round the damage increases to 1d6 piercing damage, on the third round the damage is 1d8, and on the fourth round it is 1d10 damage, and on the fifth and all following rounds it increases to 1d12 piercing damage.

At Higher Levels. If cast at 4th level, the victim takes 1d6 piercing damage on the first round, which increases each subsequent round, to a total of 1d12 piercing damage per round. At 5th level, the damage starts off at 1d8 on the first round, then at 6th level it starts at 1d10 piercing damage, and at 7th level it starts at 1d12 piercing damage.
