- Pariahs. Goblins are poorly treated in society and have disadvantage on Charisma checks with other peoples. However, the insular tendency of Goblin society provides advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with another goblin.
- Survival Instinct. While goblins are a loud and fractious people, they have a powerful will to survive. You can take either the Dash, Dodge or Disengage actions using your bonus action. You also gain proficiency with the Stealth and Survival skills.

## Scoundrel Class Features
[[Ruins of Symbaroum Class Scoundrel]]

## Level 1

### expertise
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficien- cies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

### Backstab
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with a melee weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. You must be proficient with the weapon used. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t inca- pacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Backstab column of the Scoundrel table.

Backstab Bonus: Level 5 3d6

## The Darkened Path
Like your former master, you are used to bearing Corruption as you seek power. When you make a Corruption check, you have advantage on the d20 roll. Note: this is for the initial roll to determine if you gain a mark of Corruption, not the roll to determine the mark’s nature.

## Channeling 
You were taught some of the lesser powers of your sorcerous master. Like other Sorcerers, your spellcasting ability modifier is Charisma. You learn spells from the Sorcerer tradition list.

Corruption threshold = (your proficiency bonus × 2) + your Charisma modifier  
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

You know two cantrips and one 1st level spell from the sor- cerer list, plus the detect magic spell. You do not have any favored spells. You learn spells according to the following chart, and can cast any spell you know at any time, gaining Corruption each time:




| lvl | cantrips | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
| --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 2        | 1   |     |     |     |
| 3   | 3        | 2   | 1   |     |     |
| 6   | 4        | 3   | 2   | 1   |     |
| 9   | 5        | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| 13  | 5        | 4   | 4   | 3   | 2   |
| 17  | 5        | 4   | 4   | 4   | 3   |

You have a natural talent to create elixirs. You can also make a DC 10 Intelligence (Alchemist’s supplies) check to produce one dose of a weak or basic elixir. You must take an extended rest before using your talent again to manufacture an elixir.
- When you reach 9th level, you can make a DC 15 Intelli- gence (Alchemist’s supplies) check to produce one dose of a moderate elixir or 1d3+1 doses of a weak or basic elixir. You must take an extended rest before using your talent again to manufacture an elixir.
- When you attain 17th level, you can make a DC 20 Intel- ligence (Alchemist’s supplies) check to produce one dose of a strong elixir, or 1d3+1 doses of a moderate elixir, or 1d6+2 doses of a weak or basic elixir. You must take an extended rest before using your talent again to manufacture an elixir.

## Level 4

[[Ruins class Feats Nimble]]
• Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher.  
You are extraordinarily dexterous:  
• Your base speed increases by 10 feet.  
• You can make a Dexterity(Acrobatics)check in stead of a Strength (Athletics) check to climb surfaces.
