# Dispel Evil and Good 
_5th-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.    
You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.    
**Break Enchantment.** As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.    
**Dismissal.** As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn't there already). If they aren't on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.

This spell affects all units within 1 hex of the caster. If the affected units are enchanted or undead creatures, they must make a successful saving throw versus Spells or be destroyed. Affected enchanted or undead units may not make melee attacks against the caster’s unit. The spell lasts as long as the caster concentrates.

| Range:    | 30'    |
|:--------- |:------ |
| Divine    | 5      |
| Duration: | 1 turn |

When this spell is cast, the caster can take no other action but concentrate on the spell for the entire duration. All undead or other enchanted creatures that come within 30' of the caster must succeed in a saving throw versus Death or be destroyed. Any creature that makes this saving throw will instead flee from the affected area. Instead of casting the spell in a 30' radius, the caster can direct the spell at one monster only, and that monster saves with a -2 penalty. Casting dispel evil upon an unholy place or shrine can sometimes rid the place of evil (Judge's discretion). In addition, dispel evil can be used to remove a cursed item from a being within the spell range; doing so discharges and ends the spell.
