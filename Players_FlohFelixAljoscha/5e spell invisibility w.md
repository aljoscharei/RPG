invisiBiLity

2nd-level illusion

Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: Touch  
Components: V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A single creature that you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

**At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 2nd.**



The fact that being Invisible has two bullet points will be extra important in just a minute. But for now let’s take a look at the first one. You become impossible to see–but not impossible to detect. The noise you make and tracks you leave still give away your location. Meaning that without a silence spell, if you cast invisibility on yourself in combat, everyone still knows exactly where you are and can attack you.

Of course, thanks to the second bullet point, anyone attacking you has disadvantage. But that means you can still be easily included in an area of effect, or the monk can rush across the room to try and stunning fist you.

The other thing worth mentioning is that you are heavily obscured for the purpose of hiding. That’s a mechanical way of representing the fact that you can’t be seen. And more importantly, it means you can hide without having to obscure your position from someone [[202202101906 5e Actions in Combat Hide]]. Normally if you want to hide in combat you have to get out of sight of the creature you’re hiding from. You can’t just be in a corridor and shout _stealth check!_ at your DM. Unless you’re invisible, that is.
This goes for enemies too. If a spellcaster vanishes right in front of you with invisibility? You still know exactly where they are until they make that hide check. Noise, footprints, and the like give them away.


- This makes no sense. If you can see, you don't have disadvantage.
- But what if you want to counter that advantage? That’s when invisibility gets real weird. 
	- Because invisibility isn’t just about not being seen. It’s also about getting advantage and giving your enemies disadvantage on attack rolls in combat. For normal invisibility, it’s most often about the defensive uses of it. It all comes down to that second bullet point. In a big Sage Advice Live panel last year, D&D’s lead rules designer, Jeremy Crawford broke it down: In a nutshell, even being able to see an invisible creature with magic doesn’t negate the second bullet point. You need a spell like Faerie Fire which _specifically_ says it negates the benefit of being invisible.
	- Faerie Fire is one of the only spells that does this. [[see_invisibility w]] doesn’t. Even  [[true seeing illusions wc]], the most powerful Illusion piercing spell in the game, doesn’t do this. Same goes for creatures and characters that naturally have [[5e Blindsight]]. This leads to the odd occasion of fighting a Gelatinous Cube (which has blindsight) and it still having disadvantage to attack the invisible character, but not the non-invisible person trying to hide next to them.
	- So being able to see an invisible person looks like the **predator**.
	- So to sum up? If you’re invisible you can run and you _can_ hide, but unless you do, everyone knows where you are. But even if they can see you, they still can’t hit you.
