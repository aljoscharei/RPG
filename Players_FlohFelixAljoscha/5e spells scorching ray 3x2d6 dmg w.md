## The pros of Scorching Ray are:

-   Assuming no attacks miss, it does more damage than Guiding Bolt.
-   You have the option to attack multiple targets when using Scorching Ray.
-   Eventually, when you have higher level spell slots, it will scale much better than Guiding Bolt.
-   Scorching Ray works with the Elemental Adept feat - which allows you to ignore fire resistance and raises the floor on your minimum damage. (Credit - [yinzanat](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/25763/yinzanat))
-   Against enemy spellcasters, Scorching Ray provides more opportunities to break their concentration. (Credit - [gburton](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/23609/gburton))

## The cons of Scorching Ray are:

-   It deals fire damage instead of radiant damage. While this is situational, there are more monsters in the Monster Manual that resist fire than resist radiant.
-   It does not grant advantage to the next attack roll against your target.
-   If you have advantage for being hidden it will not apply to your second and third attack.

## The thing that could be either, depending on how superstitious you are about your dice (and what the AC of your target is):

-   Scorching Ray makes three separate attack rolls.

## You would want to use Scorching Ray if:

-   There are multiple targets that you are confident in your ability to hit.
-   You are fighting something that is vulnerable to fire damage.
-   You need to deal more damage right now.

## You would want to use Guiding Bolt if:

-   You need to set an ally up for an upcoming attack against the same target.
-   Your allies are having a hard time landing attacks against the target.
-   Your next ally to attack is a rogue who will get sneak attack damage from the advantage. (Credit - [DaleM](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/6203/dale-m))
-   There is only one target. (You may wish also just not upcasting Guiding Bolt in this scenario and relying on your party to use the advantage.)
-   You have advantage on this attack (ie you are hidden).
