LivinG fortress

6th-level [[transmutation spells]] (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 hour 
Range: 10 ft. 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Special

You create a fortress of living trees and thorny bushes that erupt from the local growth. The fortress is approximately 20 feet on a side and no higher than 20 feet. Its exact layout is determined by the caster. Each wall and the canopy roof have 50 hit points, AC 15, resistance to non-magical piercing damage and immunity to poison and psychic damage. At the start of a round, a damaged section regenerates 5 hit points of damage.

You can allow creatures of your choice to enter or exit the fortress and teach them special words to allow them passage even if youâ€™re not there. Inside the fortress it is always dry and a comfortable temperature. Other creatures who attempt to enter (or leave) the fortress must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d12 piercing damage on a failure or half that on a success.

The fortress lives a season (three months) and then the spell must be cast again or the magic will fade and it will start to wither away.
