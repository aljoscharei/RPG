    desc: [[suggestion mind control w]]
  - name: Privileged
    desc: "You are a noble by blood and are therefore given advan- tages that others simply cannot have or must pay for, in either silver or hard work, to obtain. You have advantage on introductions for social challenges within your own so- ciety unless you strive to accomplish something which is questionable or that may be next to impossible to achieve."
  - name: The Darkened Path
    desc: "Sorcerers are used to bearing Corruption as they seek to gain ever greater power. When you make a Corruption check, you have advantage on the d20 roll. Note: this is for the initial roll to determine if you gain a mark of Corruption, not the roll to determine the mark’s nature"
  - name: The Shadowed Slope
    desc: "At 3rd level when you cast an unfavored spell of 4th level or lower, and you have permanent Corruption equal to the spell level or higher, you gain one less temporary Corruption than normal, to a minimum of 1 point."
  - name: "At 2nd level, you may choose a spell that you do not already know that is on your mystic approach spell list, has the ritual tag, and does not exceed your current maximum spell level. If you do so, you gain permanent Corruption (see page 37) equal to half the spell level, rounded up. If the ritual is a cantrip, you gain no permanent Corruption. You can only cast the chosen spell as a ritual – the ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal and can only be cast at its base level. You gain no Corruption from casting one of these spells. You may also learn another spell as a ritual using these rules at 5th, 7th, 11th and 14th level."
  - name: Contacts
    desc: "Ambrians are very sociable and end up knowing many folk. You might have served in an organization or traveled far and wide. With a successful DC 10 Charis- ma (Persuasion) check you can find out about a person who should be able to help with a specific question or precarious situation. The contact may not be available – that depends on the GM’s judgment of your faction. When it comes to specifying a faction for the character’s contact, suitable options include: Ordo Magica."

  - name: Fire Bolt

  - name: Poison Spray
