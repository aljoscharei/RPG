# Mending 
_Transmutation cantrip_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.    
This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.
