# Spellcasrting

You are a wielder of arcane might, drawing on unseen powers to bend the world to your will. However, such changes are not without a price and mystics face a constant threat of gaining Corruption that can ruin their body and soul. For more about [[Ruins of Symbaroum Corruption]], see page 37.

## Cantrips
At 1st level, you know **six** cantrips of your choice from the spell list for your mystical approach. When you cast most cantrips (see Favored Spells, below) you gain 1 point of temporary Corruption.

## Leveled Spells

You know **two** 1st level spells from the spell list belonging to your mystical approach. When you gain a level in mystic you learn another spell, which can be any spell on your list, up to the spell level shown on the Mystic table. You can also swap one spell you already know for another one of the same level.

# Casting a Spell
- To cast a spell you take an appropriate action and gain temporary Corruption.  
- A cantrip causes 1 point of temporary Corruption while  
- a leveled spell causes 1d4 plus the spell’s level points of temporary Corruption.

- Some spells allow you to cast them using a higher level spell. You can cast up to your maximum spell level as long as you pay the additional Corruption cost.

- Spellcasting Ability: Your mystic approach determines your spellcasting ability, which affects your Corruption Threshold, spell save DC and your spell attack modifier:
	- Corruption Threshold = (your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier) × 2  
	- Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier  
	- Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier
