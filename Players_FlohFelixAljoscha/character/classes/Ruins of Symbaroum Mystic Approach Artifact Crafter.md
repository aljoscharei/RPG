The making of artifacts is a highly sought-after art form.
I DON'T LIKE THIS PART. NO ARTIFACTS EXCEPT FROM TROLLS

>...that for a long time was lost to elves and humans (no, only Troll ever knew). However, among the trolls it has been kept alive, as an almost sacred practice. Lately, the knowledge has been revived by humans and elves, in both cases thanks to the trolls of Davokar. The elves received it as a gift from a former ally, to aid them in these dark days, but how Ordo Magica managed to get their hands on the lost art is not known. However it happened, the knowledge has spread so that every chapter soon will have at least one artifact crafter in its service.
>The sudden reemergence of artifact crafting among mystics has made others question the source of the knowledge. One belief is that the Ambrian mystics have stolen it from the trolls – maybe even captured and tortured a troll – while others suspect that the rulers of the Underworld have traded this gift in exchange for something very valuable. What version lays closest to the truth is not easily guessed and the Grand Master refuses to speak on the topic.

Titles

While the trolls may have specific titles to go with the everincreasing understanding of their artifact crafters, they have not shared these with anyone else. In Ordo Magica, artifact crafters share the same titles as other magic users and those that are self-taught can give themselves what names please them best.

Corruption

Artifact Crafters use physical objects to mitigate the effects of Corruption. They still understand Corruption based on their origin and background – for example, an Ordo Magica Artifact Crafter still views Corruption as a natural reaction to magic, just one that can be filtered and reduced by the physical presence of an artifact. Trolls see Corruption as one more piece of evidence of the darkness now consuming the world and strive to use discipline alongside their powers to slow its conquest.

Spellcasting Ability

You use talismans to help manage the cost of Corruption but otherwise use the normal mystic rules. You can favor cantrips and spells as normal, and each talisman is bonded to one spell, reducing its Corruption whenever it is cast. You use Wisdom as your spellcasting ability modifier. You learn spells from the Troll Singer tradition list [[Ruins of Symbaroum Troll Singer Spells]]

- Class Features
- Level 1: Talisman Crafter
	- During a long rest you can create a talisman to help you channel the power of a spell. You begin an adventure with one talisman already prepared. You cannot have more talismans than your proficiency bonus. While you possess the talisman, when you cast that spell you gain half the normal temporary Corruption (rounding up to a minimum of 1). When you take an extended rest, you can divest yourself of all talismans and then begin to prepare new ones with the next long rest.
- Level 3: Artifact Expert
	- At 3rd level, you know something about the powerful secrets of the old rune smiths. At higher levels you are able to create lesser artifacts.
	- At 3rd level, you can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine the spell associated with a talisman. The DC is equal to 10 plus the spell level (DC 10 for cantrips). If you do not know the spell invested into the talisman you cannot use the talisman. This counts as [[identify better as downtime activity w]]
	- At 6th level, your understanding of artifacts is extensive enough that you are not as affected by their corruptive power. You may reduce your cost of an artifact’s permanent Corruption by 1, to a minimum of 1 Corruption.
	- At 9th level, you are able to complete construction of a lesser artifact (see page 184) when you complete an extended rest (including the one before an adventure begins).
- Talisman Master
	- At 13th level you can use a number of talismans equal to twice your proficiency bonus. Making a new talisman still requires a long rest to prepare.
Artifact Master
	- At 17th level you can create one artifact of greater power. This is the work of a lifetime of learning and effort and so can only be accomplished once. The Gamemaster has further rules and sample artifacts, see page 124 in the Ruins of Symbaroum Gamemaster’s Guide.
