## Burdens
Burdens are negative traits which add to the characterâ€™s history and also provide opportunities to earn inspiration by using the negative effects in game. Using burdens is considered an optional rule (even more so than the choice to use feats themselves), so the gaming group has to reach a common understanding on whether or not to do so. You might, for example, have each character begin with a sin- gle burden, improving their stats but setting the stage for possible disaster.
