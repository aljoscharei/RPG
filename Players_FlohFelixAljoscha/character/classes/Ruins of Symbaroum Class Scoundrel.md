approach

At first level you also choose your approach, the way that your scoundrel interacts with the world: are they an Explorer, a Spy, a Treasure-hunter, a Thug, or a Sapper? Each approach deals with subterfuge and a careful approach to problems, but they typically find themselves in different environments with drastically different foes.

Your approach gives you benefits at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 13th and 17th levels.
