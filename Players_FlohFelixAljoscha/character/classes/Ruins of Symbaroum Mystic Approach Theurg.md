Corruption

- The theurgs of Prios teach that **Corruption occurs when nature is allowed to grow without being cultivated and tamed**. Corruption thrives in the wild, in chaos, that which is uncontrolled by humans – and in their encounters with Davokar they seem to find all the evidence needed to support this interpretation of the world order.
	- DAS MACHT KEINEN SINN IM KRIEG IN ALBERETOR. DA GAB ES KEINEN DUNKLEN WALD. DUNKELHEIT IM HERZEN?


Every devotee of Prios must accept the threat of Corruption and keep their inner flame burning despite the risk of taint; just as the Lightbringer Ofelya Attio is said to have proclaimed while standing at the threshold of the Dark Lords’ stronghold: “Fire shall with fire be fought, darkness shall with darkness be vanquished!”

Spellcasting Ability

Theurgs rely on the teachings of the Sun God when interpreting his teachings or calling upon his power. They use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability modifier. You learn spells from the Theurg tradition list.
THEY PREY TO THE LIGHTBRINGERS OR SAINTS TO GRANT THEM POWER.

Matter of Faith

When you reach 17th level, choose one of your ritual spells. Remove permanent Corruption equal to half its spell level, rounded up. This spell no longer weighs on your soul, since you have internalized its power as being provided solely by Prios.
