# Wizard are clearly the most powerful spellcasters. Wizardry exists only since Kullinan and the founding of the ordo magica. Thus you cannot start as a wizard. You have to earn being allowed into the ordo. So there is no classless option here. You need to be a memeber of ordo magica to learn spells up to and including level 6.

## Corruption
According to Ordo Magica, Corruption is largely misunderstood, thanks to the sermons of hot-headed theurgs and the fairy tales of witches. It all comes down to a regulated response; a reaction that occurs when a mystic uses their power to affect nature. This is not that different from what happens when some-one jumps off the stern of a boat, simultaneously pushing the boat forward with the same amount of force that goes into the jump. If the jumper is reckless, he will drop into the water; if the jumper is careful, he will land on the dock with dry shoes.

## Spellcasting Ability
- Wizards rely on the philosophy and knowledge taught to them during their time with Ordo Magica to understand the ancient secrets of the world. You use **Intelligence** as your spellcasting ability modifier. You learn spells from the Wizard tradition list [[Ruins of Symbaroum Wizard Spells]]
