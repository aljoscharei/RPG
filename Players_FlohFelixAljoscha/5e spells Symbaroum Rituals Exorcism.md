exorcisM

5th-level transmutation, ritual

Casting Time: 1 hour  
Range: 30 feet  
Components: V, S, M (sprinkler of holy water) Duration: Instantaneous

You call out to Prios to purge the immediate area of any creature that is not native to the material world and anoint everything else with his holy water. At the end of the casting time, each extraplanar creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you can see the creature as you cast the spell (for example it is trapped within a magic circle or otherwise confined) then it has disadvantage on its saving throw. An exorcised creature cannot return to the material world until at least 24 hours have passed.
