A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [[true_resurrection max 200 y dead even if no body left c]] or a [[wish universal w not favoured]] spell.    
This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. **A magic item is unaffected by this spell.** 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
