You can exchange your Shadow with another creature. If the creature is unwilling, it is able to make a Wisdom saving throw to resist the effect. A successful save prevents the process and alerts the target. A failed saving throw indicates that the swap was successful and the target is unaware of the exchange. Your Shadow appears as the targetâ€™s Shadow and their Shadow appears as yours.
