# Confusion 
_4th-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 90 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (three nut shells)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.    
An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn. 

| d10  | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |
| 2-6  | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.                                                                                                                                            |
| 7-8  | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.     |
| 9-10 | The creature can act and move normally.                                                                                                                                                         |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.

This spell disorders (p. 13) one unit within 2 hexes of the caster. Units with 2 HD or more may avoid the effects with a saving throw versus Spells. Otherwise, the unit remains disordered for 12 combat rounds or until dispelled. The unit may not be activated during this time.

| Range:    | 120'      |
|:--------- |:--------- |
| Arcane    | 4         |
| Duration: | 12 rounds |

This spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30' radius circle around the target point to become confused, making them unable to independently determine what they will do. Creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice receive no saving throw. Those with more than 2 Hit Dice may make a saving throw versus Spells to resist the effect. A confused creature rolls 2d6 on the following table on its initiative each round to determine its actions:


| 2d6  | Behavior                                                                                             |
|:---- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-5  | Attack the caster or allies with melee or ranged weapons (or move closer if attack is not possible). |
| 6-8  | Do nothing but babble incoherently.                                                                  |
| 9-12 | Attack the creature's own party, if any.                                                             |


A confused creature which can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused creature. Any confused creature who is attacked automatically retaliates on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes.
