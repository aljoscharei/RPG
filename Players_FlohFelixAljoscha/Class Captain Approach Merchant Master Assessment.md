Assessment

As an action, you can observe a creature and make a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check to notice a weakness that you might exploit. With a success:  
- If you make an attack roll against the creature you have advantage. Once you make a successful attack roll, you no longer have advantage due to this feature.
- If you make a contested ability check,you have advantage on the roll. If you succeed at the check, you no longer have advantage due to this feature.

Alternatively, you can assess an object instead. Make a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. You must be able to see and handle the object. On a success, the GM will answer one of these questions (your choice):

- Approximately how old is this object?
- Approximately how valuable is this object?
- Who is most likely to have made this object?
- What is the most likely purpose for this object?

After using this feature on a creature or object you must take an extended rest before using this feature again on the same creature or object. You canâ€™t detect magic, but might suspect it based on appearance or origin. At 9th level, you can assess a creature or object using your bonus action instead.
