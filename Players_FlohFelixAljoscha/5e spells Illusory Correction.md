Illusory Correction

4th-level illusion

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 ft.
Components: V 
Duration: Special
[[Ruins of Symbaroum Wizard Spells]]

There are gaps between reality and our perception of it. By casting this spell, the mystic takes advantage of these discrepancies. While this spell is active, when you or another creature within range makes an **ability check, attack roll, or saving throw** you can use your **reaction** to make a correction of reality, either forcing another creature to reroll the d20 or allowing yourself to do so.

Duration:
At the end of your turn if you have used your reaction since your previous turn, you must make a spellcasting ability check to keep track of the differences between your personal reality and that which others perceive. The DC starts at 5 and increases each time by 5. If you fail the check the spell immediately ends (you cannot use your reaction to reroll).
