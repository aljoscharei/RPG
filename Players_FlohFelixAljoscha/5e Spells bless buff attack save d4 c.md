#### Bless* [[ACKS Chapter 05 Spells#Bless]]

| Range:    | 0'      |
|:--------- |:------- |
| Divine    | 2       |
| Duration: | 6 turns |

When cast before battle, bless gives the caster and his allies (within a 50' radius of the caster) a bonus of +1 to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. It may not be cast on creatures who are already engaged in melee.

Divine spellcasters of 7th level or higher may also use bless to create holy water. One casting of bless will transform 1 pint of ordinary water into holy water. Casting bless in this manner demands a sacrifice to the caster's deity worth at least 10gp. Once created, holy water will retain its potency indefinitely so long as it is kept in the vial it was blessed in. See the [Equipment Descriptions](ACKS%20Chapter%2003%20Equipment.md#equipment-descriptions) in Chapter 3 for information on holy water.

The reverse of bless is called bane. It fills the caster's enemies (within a 50' radius) with fear and doubt, causing each affected character or monster to suffer a -1 penalty on attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls, and saving throws against magical fear. Bane may also be used by chaotic divine casters of 7th level or higher, in conjunction with a sacrifice of at least 10gp, to create a vial of unholy water. Unholy water has beneficial effects when used in the animation of the dead. See Animate Dead, above.

1.  **Battle:** Allies within a 20’ square area who are not yet in melee gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and a +1 bonus to morale.
2.  **Ritual:** Casting _bless_ may also form part of rituals of purification or consecration, at the referee’s discretion.

## Reversed: Blight

Incurs a –1 penalty to morale checks, attack rolls, and damage rolls of enemies within a 20’ square area. A **save versus spells** is allowed to resist the _blight_.

This spell affects one unit within 2 hexes of the caster. The target unit must not already be in melee. The unit gains +1 on attack throws. Its morale score is increased by 1. The bless lasts the duration of the battle or until dispelled. The reverse of this spell, blight, affects one enemy unit unless a Save versus Spells is made. A blighted unit suffers -1 on its attack throws and has its morale score reduced by 1. The reversed spell also lasts the duration of the battle or until dispelled.
