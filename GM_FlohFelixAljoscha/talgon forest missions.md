![[Talgon Forest.png]]
The forest heart is dark and thick and makes it difficult to traverse terrain. The only real place to camp is Harug, a holy site of the Horned One ringed with carved stones. For no visible reason the forest doesn’t encroach within. The site itself is made of smooth stone platforms with holy patterns carved into them, small alcoves carved into trees, and the ornate pathways that lead between them. The sole attendant of the site is a dour, robed man named Rowan, who has dedicated his life to the Horned One. Rowan’s Panyar traits are more excessive than most, and include goat horns and odd, bark-like skin.

Here, the Broken are at a disadvantage. The forest beasts resent their presence, and are likely to turn their rage on them. Consequently, undead in the forest are few, and are far more likely to mount ambushes than assault a fortified position. The Chosen is too valuable a prize to forget entirely (and defeating the Legion would earn the Cinder King’s favor), but it’s no easy task to follow the Legion into here.

Talgon is one of the most pristine places left in Aldermark, but that does not make it safe. The forest does not care for intruders, and the Legion are only marginally better than their undead counterparts in the eyes of those things that call the forest home.

One of the ritual observations for the Horned One is the last hunt of the season. One of your scouts spotted a white stag, a full three paces tall, near this place. Its sighting is an opportunity: catch the stag, prepare a ritual meal of it, and the holy site you’re camped at will bless your troops.

mission rewards: 1 Food (3 uses). Blessing: +2 Morale, and each Specialist may clear all stress or remove all harm.

Talgon Forest was once less formidable. A few hundred years ago, a Panyar sect brought a cutting of the Heart Tree of Panya to take root here in Aldermark. Now, with Panya under assault by the Cinder King, this new Heart Tree may soon be the last of its kind, and its importance to the Panyar people cannot be understated. A cutting of the tree could be of strategic value to the Legion. Brave the wild guardians of the Heart Tree to take a cutting.

mission rewards: +2 Morale. Relic: Heartwood Cutting (used in later campaigns), add +10 points to final score.

mission penalties: None now. Consequences in later campaigns.

When the moon was shattered, several pieces of the Goddess Nyx fell from heaven. A large piece can be found in the forest, only a day or so out. According to preliminary reports, there are ethereal, silver, and strange creatures, only vaguely humanoid, guarding the site where the stone crashed. GM: Creatures are threat 2 and there are a dozen of them.

mission rewards: Relic: Lunar Crown. (Worn by the largest guardian, lets the wearer weave moonlight, to purify or to reveal the unseen. Donning the crown fuses it to the skull, and turns the wearer’s hair white and eyes silver. Using the crown causes level 2 harm “Burns” to the user.)

mission penalties: Nyx worshippers desert the Legion to continue seeking the relic (two deaths).
