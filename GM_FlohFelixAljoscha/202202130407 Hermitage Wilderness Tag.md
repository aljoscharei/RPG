A small hermitage was established here sometime in the past to provide solitude for some ascetic. Occasionally small clusters of hermits form around such a central point, meeting at times to check on each other or join in shared discipline. Such anchorites usually shun visitors who aren’t also devotees of their path, but occasionally a hermit wins such fame for sorcery or wisdom that pilgrims seek them out.
