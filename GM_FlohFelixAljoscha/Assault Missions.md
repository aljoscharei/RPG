ASSAULT MISSIONS

Assault missions are about conflict, typically head-on. It’s rare for an assault mission not to end in gunfire, drawn blades, or explosions.

In an assault mission, always ask: Where is the enemy weak and where are they strong? What avenues of attack are they prepared for? How would they react if a fight breaks out? What major opponents are present, and how do they enter the theater of battle?

Mission objectives will involve destruction and fighting. Sometimes the objective will be to kill a particular person or creature, but often it is to fight for a specific tactical objective. Sometimes the goal is to destroy an alchemical lab Blighter is using, or a smithy Render is forging new troops or weapons in. Sometimes it’s to hold a pass, or collapse it.

Assault mission types

The conflict in assault missions isn’t necessarily about the enemies present. People might be locals raiding, sure, but it can also be a rescue operation. People are either the challenge or the objective, but they’ll play a key role in the mission. The Wild is a force that changes the battlefield, provides an opportunity for the undead, or causes the Legion to race to acquire their target.

- People: Bandits, cults, village elders, soldiers. Insular communities. Opportunistic raiders. Hungry soldiers raiding as they flee.
- The Wild: Inclement weather, wild animals (possibly blighted), wildfires, strange terrain (such as the warding stones on the Long Road or the mystical woods of Talgon Forest).
- Undead: Engaging at least a squad and one Elite of undead, either head- on or opportunistically.
- Powerful Undead: Contesting at least one Infamous (possibly a Lieutenant in the later session) and trying to derail their plans.
