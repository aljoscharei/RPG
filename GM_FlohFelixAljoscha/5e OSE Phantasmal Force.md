## OSE

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** 240’

A visual illusion of the caster’s choosing manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types of illusions may be created:

1.  **An illusionary monster:** That can be directed to attack. The monster has an Armour Class of 9 [10] and will vanish if hit in combat.
2.  **An illusionary attack:** For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc. Targets who **save versus spells** are unaffected.
3.  **A scene:** Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched.

**Stipulations:** The following apply:

-   **Concentration:** Is required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves or loses concentration, the spell ends.
-   **Illusionary monsters or attacks:** May appear to be harmful but no real damage is ever inflicted. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralysed, and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
-   **Illusions from imagination:** If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.

You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.  

The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.  
  
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.  
  
While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.  
  
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

This spell is identical to permanent illusion, except that it may not replicate spells with an auditory, thermal, or tactile component. Its duration is limited to the caster’s concentration.

| Range:    | 240'          |

| Duration: | concentration |

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 20'x20'x20'. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates upon it.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they will have an Armor Class of 0 and will disappear if hit in combat. If used to simulate an attack spell or an attacking creature, the illusory damage done will be equivalent to the normal damage for any attack form simulated. A successful save versus Spells, however, will allow victims to avoid all damage. Illusory damage is not real. Those "killed" or injured will realize they are unharmed (at least from this spell) after 1d3 rounds.
