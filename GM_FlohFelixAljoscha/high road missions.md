Largely used as a pilgrimage route and for minor trade in the summer months, this is a route that cuts above the tree line and up to where the air is thin. The lower altitudes possess a stark beauty. Trees shift to coniferous, and eventually stop altogether, leaving mostly lichen-covered rock. Animal life dwindles, until the only beasts frequently seen are small mountain rodents and the birds studying you from above.

Though still traveled, upkeep of the path hasn’t been a priority, even more so since the war started. Now the decrepit sky bridges linking the shale and granite plateaus are mostly frequented by refugees escaping the new horrors the Broken have cooked up.

Most passage through these lands is hiking or climbing, due to the uncertainty of the quality of the bridges. It’s easy to be ambushed, and the lack of terrain options makes it hard to run from a fight. Food and fuel are scarce, and the cold winds make travel treacherous and slow. Often the altitude and weather are enemies as dangerous as the ones chasing the Legion.

These narrow paths and stone bridges are also a source of strength. Undead will have to follow the same roads, and the sky bridges form natural bottlenecks on which to fight them. Fighting the undead is never without cost, but here the odds are far closer to even, if you can turn the terrain to your advantage.

mission type: Supply favor: Mercy

Boryev Natanovich, an elder and famous warlord of the largest of the Zemyati clans, is trapped on an isolated butte, circled by high mountain lizards looking to eat his bones. He won’t abandon the small refugee camp he’s protecting, but doesn’t have enough warriors to shield them on the move. Rescuing a Zemyati elder would mean a lot to the mountain tribes.

mission rewards: +3 Morale. +1 Laborers (a Zemyati elder and refugees). The Zemyati (as a people) will owe the Legion a debt.

mission penalties: -1 Morale if the Legion has a Zemyati Specialist.

mission type: Assault favor: All

Archangel Bridge is a stone bridge, 300 paces long, carved with ornate religious imagery, stone railings, and steps leading up and down either side. It’s also one of the only direct routes to Skydagger. Deploy two squads, three Specialists, and your Chosen, who suspects that holding here will force an enemy Broken to take the field. Help your Chosen fight off two waves of enemies, and keep them safe from aerial and ranged units while they duel the Broken, to buy the Legion time at Skydagger.

mission rewards: +5 Morale. -3 Time. mission penalties: None.

mission type: Religious favor: Holy, Mystic

The Pedestal Monastery was abandoned years ago, but deep inside its sanctum is an artifact created from the Godswar, which was once fiercely fought over until the ascetics were entrusted with it. Though their order died out, they’ve left the halls filled with death traps and snares to meet Legion and undead alike seeking the Bell of Keening.

mission rewards: +2 Morale. Relic: The Bell of Keening. (When rung, mystic effects in earshot fade. It does not affect alchemy or the animating power of the undead. Each time it is used, a crack in the bell forms. It shatters when rung twice more.)

mission penalties: None.
