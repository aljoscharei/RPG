### Improvising Damage

A monster or effect typically specifies the amount of damage it deals. In some cases, though, you need to determine damage on the fly. The Improvising Damage table gives you suggestions for when you do so.

Damage Severity and Level
| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |
| --------------- | ------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1st–4th         | 1d10    | 2d10      | 4d10   |
| 5th–10th        | 2d10    | 4d10      | 10d10  |
| 11th–16th       | 4d10    | 10d10     | 18d10  |
| 17th–20th       | 10d10   | 18d10     | 24d10  |

Damage sufficient to cause a **setback** rarely poses a risk of death to characters of the level shown, but a severely weakened character might be laid low by this damage.

In contrast, **dangerous** damage values pose a significant threat to weaker characters and could potentially kill a character of the level shown if that character is missing many hit points.

As the name suggests, **deadly** damage is enough to drop a character of the level shown to 0 hit points. This level of damage can kill even powerful characters outright if they are already wounded.
