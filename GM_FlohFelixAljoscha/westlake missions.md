![[Westlake.png]]

Though Karlsburg (on the west shore of the Tigeria) was the Aldermark capital, Westlake may be its proudest city. The seat of the Church of the Twins (the gods of Aldermark), it has prospered for years by channeling trade from the coast, up the river, and west into Aldermark proper. Its massive walls are 50 handbreadths high and decorated with the red and gold colors of the city.

Westlake has yet to fall to the undead horde. In the initial push, the undead stopped here. Before the Cinder King arrived in person to bring down the walls himself, the Eastern Kingdoms’ reinforcements, with their newly invented Black Shot, drove the undead forces back over the Tigeria to regroup. Now, as the undead forces march east again, the city considers itself an untouchable bastion.

Before the gates is a tent city of refugees seeking the shelter of the walls but stymied by the protocols the council has put in place. Curfew is strictly maintained and entry and egress from the city is tightly controlled, with many aspects of the population’s lives regimented in preparation for the oncoming siege.

Benritza, a powerful ruling council member, needs an escort for her daughter Maja to retrieve family heirlooms from a country manor a few days’ travel out.

Westlakers don’t recognize that missing people and an odd disease of the blood are heralds of something more sinister, but the Annals of the Legion do. The Last Emperor was destroyed when practicing similar rites, which use sacrifice and blood drinking to grant great arcane power. A high priestess is doing dark rituals beneath her gothic cathedral, using unwanted and unexpected passers-through. GM: Have each player pick a Specialist to play, and investigate these symptoms. Requires: Vital, Only Specialists

mission rewards: +2 Morale. +2 Supply. 1 Religious Supplies. mission penalties: Two Legionnaires go missing (two deaths).
