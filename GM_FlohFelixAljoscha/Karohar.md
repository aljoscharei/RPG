Unlike the Odavs, the warmongering Karits are distrustful, if not hostile, towards the new lords of the realm. This can probably be explained by the fact that Ambrian treasure-hunters have invaded their territory during the past decades, scaring game away and attracting elves. Or could it possibly have something to do with what happened to the former ally of Karohar â€“ Haloban and his Jezites? Regardless, the territory of the Karits is far from safe.
