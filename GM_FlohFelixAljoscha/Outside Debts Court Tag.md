The court owes something awful to a pitiless outside power, whether a rival court, an enemy of their homeland, a vile sorcerer, a merciless banker, or a grasping lord. The consequences of failing to repay the debt would be catastrophic, but the court can’t afford to do so without some members of them being ruined by the price, whether in coin, criminal conviction, disgrace, or eternal damnation.

5.  E  Ruler who means to shift the debt to another, Savage enforcer of the debt, Culprit who brought the debt on them with their ambitions
    
6.  F  Innocent being forced to pay the price, Suspicious investigator looking into the debt, Past victim of the creditor’s cruel ways
    

C Revealing the debt’s existence would ruin the court, The creditor completely deserves to be paid, An old rival has bought the debt and now holds it

T Riches needed to pay off the debt, Proof that the contract was invalid, The document or token that is needed to enforce the debt

P Lair of the creditor, Court holding being sold or given away to help satisfy the debt, Great court ceremony made insultingly meager to save money
