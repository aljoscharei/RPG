A fearsome migration of dangerous creatures crosses this area at certain times of the month or year. During this migration an invincible wave of these entities crosses the site, perhaps to get from one underground entrance to another, or to move from one feeding site to the next, or to immerse themselves in some critical magical aura or ancient radiation. Despite this, there must be something valuable in this area that tempts outsiders to risk being here when the living tide arrives.

E Monstrously huge alpha of the tide, Cultist who worships the creatures of the tide, Sorcerer trying to bend the swarm to his will

F Treasure seeker daring the migration schedule, Scholar of these beasts, Local trapped here at the wrong time

C The tideâ€™s schedule is dangerously unpredictable, The creatures are always present but only become dangerous during the migration, The migration path changes very often

T Precious animal byproduct of the swarm, Treasure found by a too-slow seeker, Key to predicting or controlling the swarm

P Trail stripped bare by the tide, Massive breeding ground, Island full of cowering refugees
