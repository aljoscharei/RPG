RECON MISSIONS

Recon missions are about discovery, and operate far away from the Legion. These missions are about learning what the enemy is up to, finding and rescuing someone or something, scouting paths, and learning what the source of a problem is.

In a recon mission, ask: What thing is not what it seems, or how it is hidden? How will you reveal that truth? Is the intel that the mission provides from encountering a specific undead, or are there plans and schematics to recover?

Mission objectives should be about gaining intelligence from a place and learning something that isn’t known. Sometimes through observation, sometimes through stealing or acquiring things that are written down (such as schematics or maps), and sometimes through finding local sources with vital intelligence you need.

## recon mission types

Recon mission types are always about the thing being reconnoitered.

- Area Recon: Investigate an area for a resource, group, or person. You might have heard of undead moving into the area, or want to make sure the Legion isn’t passing by an infested wood. You might look for resources.
- Route Recon: Find a path through an area that leads from or to a place, or through the theater of war.
- Troop Recon: Spy on and record troop movements, activities, and numbers. Figure out their movements or strategies.
- Infiltration: Going behind enemy lines, usually to recover some information.
- Exfiltration: Rescuing a person from behind enemy lines, usually to recover some information.
- Dangerous: Also include an Infamous or higher threat opponent. rewards

Recon missions always provide intel, but can also provide assets, troops, or simply time. See Mission Rewards (page 322) for more details.

penalties

Recon missions are among the more dangerous missions, and can lead to deaths in the Legion, loss of time, or increased pressure if they are failed or not completed. See Mission Penalties (page 323) for more details.
