    desc: "The quasit can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a bat (speed 10 feet fly 40 ft.), a centipede (40 ft., climb 40 ft.), or a toad (40 ft., swim 40 ft.), or back into its true form.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
  - name: "Scare (1/Day)"
    desc: "One creature of the quasit's choice within 20 feet of it must succeed on a 10 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the quasit is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success."
