The drow can dismiss darkness in this way no more than once per turn."

    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and 10 (3d6) poison damage. The drow can then fill an unoccupied 5-foot cube within 5 feet of the target with magical darkness, which remains for 1 minute."
  - name: "Hand Crossbow"
    desc: "Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it."
