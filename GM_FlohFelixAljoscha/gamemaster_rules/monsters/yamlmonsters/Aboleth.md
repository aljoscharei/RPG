Daily Monster Tactics #20 - Aboleths



-

### Aboleth in its Lair

Aboleths are ancient alien fish straight out of a Lovecraft story. They’re built like brutes but come with a strange array of psychic abilities, too. Their most significant advantage is their legendary actions, which allows them to make attacks at the cost of only one legendary action. This attack frees up their standard actions and movement for defense.

Basics

  
**Aboleths fight in their lairs only.** An aboleth outside of its lair is relatively weak. In the rare instance that the characters find an aboleth outside of its lair, the aboleth uses social skills to negotiate with the party, using its telepathy to probe its foes' deepest desires.

  
**Aboleths fight with minions.** An aboleth in its lair should always have a handful of minions protecting it. Standard minions include kuo-toas, troglodytes, skum, locathah, and chuuls. The minions always go first, drawing attacks and forcing spellcasters to expend spell slots.  

### Target the Weakling

**At the start of combat, aboleths stay out of sight.** The aboleth hangs back more than 60 feet, observing its foes from afar while it lets its minions do all the work. Aboleths have 120 feet of darkvision, so only a very few creatures can see them from this distance. Meanwhile, it takes the Dodge action or Hides to ensure that it can’t get hit by those who can see it.

  
**Aboleths rely on their lair actions.** While the aboleth uses its main action to Dodge, it relies on its lair actions with better range.

  
**First lair action: grasping tide.** During the first round of combat, the aboleth uses grasping tide, targeting the weakest-looking targets first (spellcasters, especially wizards). It pulls targets up to 20 feet towards it.

  
**Swim near a swimming target.** The aboleth swims within 10 feet of a submerged target. Meanwhile, it takes the Dodge action to protect itself until it can get its following lair action. If the target tries to swim away, the aboleth can hit it with its tentacles. It can also use its legendary actions to hit the target with its tail.

  
**Second lair action: phantasmal force.** The aboleth uses its _phantasmal force_ to distract all other targets present. The spell keeps the other targets busy so that the aboleth can focus its attention on the submerged targets.

  
**The aboleth continues to Dodge and rely on its tail.** So long as the target remains in the water, the aboleth uses its regular action to Dodge while it uses its tail swipe legendary action. This pattern continues until it either kills the target or the other targets overcome their _phantasmal forces_.

  
**The aboleth steals the corpse.** After the aboleth kills the creature in the water, it grabs the target’s body (as part of its object interaction) and swims back into the dark recesses of its pool, recognizing that its allies will want to rescue it. Once a target is incapacitated, it is no longer “grappled” by the aboleth, so the aboleth can move its full speed so long as the target and its equipment don’t weigh more than 210 pounds.  

### Bait the Others

**The aboleth waits for the targets to come to it.** With its “bait,” the aboleth swims to a dark, submerged area of its choice, knowing that the party will follow. It torments targets with its illusory image regional effect or its telepathy.

  
**The aboleth moves, Dodges, and uses rage conduit.** Once the characters take the bait, the aboleth spends its turns swimming 60-90 feet away from them, using its rage conduit lair action every other round to target all characters dumb enough to follow after it. It takes cover whenever it can, hiding behind coral and rocks below the surface. If it can’t use rage conduit, it instead draws targets towards it, then uses its legendary actions to smack targets with its tail, forcing attacks of opportunity whenever it can.

  
**Aboleths are insanely patient.** The aboleth will continue this pattern for as long as it needs to, knowing that the party will tire of its tactics long before it tires of them.

  
**Aboleths don’t fear death.** When the aboleth’s body is destroyed, the aboleth’s spirit returns to the Elemental Plane of Water. They fight until destroyed.
