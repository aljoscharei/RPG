    desc: "The yochlol transforms into toxic mist or reverts to its true form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is also transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to nonmagical damage. While in mist form, the yochlol can enter a creature's space and stop there. Each time that creature starts its turn with the yochlol in its space, the creature must succeed on a 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated."
