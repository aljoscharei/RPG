  - name: "Kiss"
    desc: "The vargouille kisses one incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a daylight spell; don't count that time. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse."
  - name: "Stunning Shriek"
    desc: "The vargouille shrieks. Each humanoid and beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the vargouille's next turn. While frightened in this way, a target is stunned. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for 1 hour."
