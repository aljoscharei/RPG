actions:
  - name: "Multiattack (Yuan-ti Form Only)"
    desc: "The yuan-ti makes one constrict attack and one scimitar attack."
  - name: "Constrict"
    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the yuan-ti can't constrict another target."

    desc: "The yuan-ti taps into the nightmares of a creature it can see within 60 feet of it and creates an illusory, immobile manifestation of the creature's deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage and is frightened of the manifestation, believing it to be real. The yuan-ti must concentrate to maintain the illusion (as if concentrating on a spell), which lasts for up to 1 minute and can't be harmed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the illusion on a success, or taking 11 (2d10) psychic damage on a failure."
