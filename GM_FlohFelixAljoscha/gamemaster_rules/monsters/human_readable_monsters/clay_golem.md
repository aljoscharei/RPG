**Speed** 20 ft. 

| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 20 (+5) | 9 (−1)  | 18 (+4) | 3 (−4)  | 8 (−1)  | 1 (−5)  |

**Damage Immunities** acid, poison, psychic; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9    
**Languages** understands the languages of its creator but can't speak    
**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP) 

**Acid Absorption.** Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.    
**Berserk.** Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.    
**Immutable Form.** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.    
**Magic Resistance.** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.    
**Magic Weapons.** The golem's weapon attacks are magical. 

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The golem makes two slam attacks.    
**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.    
**Haste (Recharge 5–6).** Until the end of its next turn, the golem magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.


# Narrative
Do its attacks drain your will to live? Or it simply hits so hard you never get up again? Or it attacks in such a way that the wounds never heal properly

- Regarding the title of the thread, tradition has the weird hit point draining power; it started because the original MM has a poorly worded sentence that meant to describe how to repair a clay golem (a Heal spell cast by a 17th level cleric) but was worded in a way that a lot of tables thought if you were hurt by a clay golem you could only be healed by a 17th level cleric (Rob Kuntz later [confirmed](http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=16993&start=705) the MM was describing how to repair the golem, not an extra nasty power for it). Given the "game" origin of the power (and one not particularly rooted in the monsters real world mythology) you have a lot of leeway on how to fluff it.

- The factual explanation has already been given, so I'll just add the suggestion that maybe the golem's blows make the flesh and bones of its victims squelch and splatter like wet clay, leaving permanent holes and deformations on their bodies which only extremely powerful magic can heal...
