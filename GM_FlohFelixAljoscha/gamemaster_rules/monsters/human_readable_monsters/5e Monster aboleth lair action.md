name: Aboleth
cr: 10
type: abberation


Aboleths lair in subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by the ruins of an ancient, fallen aboleth city. An aboleth spends most of its existence underwater, surfacing occasionally to treat with visitors or deranged worshipers.

#### Lair Actions

When fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

-   The aboleth casts [[5e OSE Phantasmal Force]] (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this effect, the aboleth can’t take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth’s [[5e OSE Phantasmal Force]]  lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected.
-   Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked [[5e Conditions Prone]]. The aboleth can’t use this lair action again until it has used a different one.
-   Water in the aboleth’s lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature’s rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can’t use this lair action again until it has used a different one.

#### Regional Effects

The region containing an aboleth’s lair is warped by the creature’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

-   Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth’s lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.
-   Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes.
-   As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature [[202202102000 5e Conditions Charmed]] by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image’s position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.

If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of 3d10 days.

Aboleth  
  
These were supposed to be sort of creepy Lovecraftian menaces from the deep. But if you never read Lovecraft when you first got ahold of the Monster Manual 2 because you were a little kid at the time then this is just like a really fucked up whale that hates you.  
  
If it wasn't a classic, like a dragon or a hydra, then you pretty much had only the illustration to go by to figure out what the fuck is the idea with a monster.  
  
Strangely enough, I am right back in this position with my players now. This is how meeting an aboleth would go with my group:  
  
Me: "...and it looks...like...this!"  
KK: "What the fuck is that?"  
Me: "It's an aboleth, an ancient and inscrutable race that lives deep beneath the sea, older than man, older than the tides, older than the gods, older than...."  
Mandy: "So it's like a Lovecraft thing?"  
Frankie: "What's a Lovecraft thing?"  
Daniel: "He was like this science fiction writer who wrote about, like, big monsters that looked like that."  
KK: "So it's like a space fish that's old?"  
Connie: "Can I pickpocket it?"
