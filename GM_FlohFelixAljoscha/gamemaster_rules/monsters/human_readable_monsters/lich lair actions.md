### A Lich’s Lair

A lich often haunts the abode it favored in life, such as a lonely tower, a haunted ruin, or an academy of black magic. Alternatively, some liches construct secret tombs filled with powerful guardians and traps.

Everything about a lich’s lair reflects its keen mind and wicked cunning, including the magic and mundane traps that secure it. Undead, constructs, and bound demons lurk in shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy those who dare to disturb the lich’s work.

A lich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 22 (41,000 XP).



#### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lich can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the lich can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

-   The lich rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.
-   The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich’s lair.
-   The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear.

only 4-5 actions but many spells to choose from. If Fighter or paladin go in initiative before the lich, then it is dead because ony 135 Hp. 
Give it a shield guardian, which can take over some of the dmg [[shield_guardian]]

Pre-cast:

## Description
Liches are the remains of great wizards who embrace undeath as a means of preserving themselves. They further their own power at any cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except where those affairs interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn’t hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.

A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time.

_**Secrets of Undeath.**_ No wizard takes up the path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. **Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath**, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.

#### Phylactery
[[Phylactery Horcrux]]


**Death and Restoration.**_ When a lich’s body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. **Within days,** a new body reforms next to the lich’s phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.

Destroying a lich’s phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.

#### Lonely Existence
From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it, most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its lair.

Few liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.

_**Magic Collectors.**_ Liches collect spells and magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spellbooks, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack.

_**Undead Nature.**_ A lich doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

# The Deadly Lich

by [Mike](https://slyflourish.com/about_mike_shea.html) on 21 November 2016

Few creatures in the world of [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.amazon.com/Players-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons-Wizards/dp/0786965606/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=slyflourish-20&linkCode=w01&linkId=BRA3KRG36IN5H3YC&creativeASIN=0786965606) are as feared as the lich — or as hard to run. As legendary monsters, lichs are intended to effectively fight a group of characters; already a daunting task. They're wide range of spells and reliance on particular abilities to survive means they're much harder to run than other legendary monsters like dragons.

Running a poor lich encounter can be a real heartbreak. We're not likely to do it often so when we do it and it doesn't run well, we feel the missed opportunity.

A lich deserves better.

In today's article, we're going to dive deep into the the lich with a focus on understanding how best to run it at the table, not just so it retains its deadly reputation but so it's also a fun foe to fight.

![](https://slyflourish.com/images/lich.jpg)

## Lich Combat Checklist

The following is a checklist on running the lich in combat to its full potential as written.

-   Before the battle begins, consider what allies protect the lich. Shield guardians, stone golems, or iron golems make excellent bodyguards. Consider adding the shield guardian's _bound_ ability to one or more of these bodyguards.
-   Before the battle begins, let the lich pre-cast _globe of invulnerability_ and _mirror image_. Keep track of _mirror image_ during the fight. Remember that _globe of invulnerability_ stops enemy _counterspells_.
-   For **lair actions**, rotate between the damage tether and the attacking apparitions on characters with low constitutions like rogues and spellcasters. The tether is another way to protect the lich from lots of damage.
-   For **legendary actions**, stick to the _ray of frost_ cantrip which inflicts a respectable 18 damage per hit.
-   For **reactions**, use _shield_ if the lich is getting hit hard in melee or _counterspell_ if casters are casting debilitating spells that the lich's legendary actions won't take care of.
-   Expect the lich to only get about four **actions** in a given battle. For actions, use _finger of death_ and _power word kill_ followed by _disintegrate_ and _blight_.

If you want to power up your deadly lich, consider the following modifications:

-   Maximize the lich's hit points to 198 or double them to about 250. Let it drink a _potion of invulnerability_ to give it resistance to all damage.
-   Arm the lich with powerful magic items like a **staff of power** (+2 AC, spell attacks, and spell DCs), **black robes of the archmagi** (base AC 15, +2 spell DC and spell attacks, advantage on spell saving throws). Write down these stat changes.
-   Give the lich access to any wizard spell instead of sticking to the prepared spell list. Lichs are smarter than we are. In addition to _power word kill_ and _finger of death_, some good spells to consider include _meteor swarm_, _prismatic spray_, _chain lightning_, and _circle of death_.
-   For a really nasty lich, maximize its spell damage.

## Protecting the Lich

As powerful as they are, a lich can still be defeated, sometimes _easily_, if it faces a lot of damage all at once. Though it has a towering challenge rating of 21 (22 in its lair), the lich's 135 hit points might disappear within one turn of a fighter using action surge or a paladin throwing out a pile of smites. If initiative goes against the lich, the lich could fall before ever getting an action.

There are many ways to shore up this weakness. Here are a few:

**_Increase hit points_**. The easiest way to help our lich survive is to increase its hit points to the maximum of 198. This is still within range of the lich's hit dice pool.

**Potion of invulnerability**. If your characters are able to dish out tremendous damage, the lich might drink a concoction similar to a potion of invulnerability before the battle begins, letting it resist all damage.

**Damage tether lair action**. One of the three lair actions of the lich lets it bond with an enemy and share the damage it takes with that enemy. It relies on a constitution saving throw to pass that damage so best to cast it on low constitution classes such as spellcasters or light weapon wielders.

**Shield Guardians**: A lich might have one or more shield guardian bodyguards and use their _bound_ ability to share damage with this guardian. Normally a wizard would only have one such guardian but lichs are really powerful. Not only might they have more than one shield guardian but they might even have more powerful shield guardians, like, say, iron golems.

There's a fun strategy involved in removing these guardians from the field so one can start actually hitting the lich itself. Actual shield guardians have a lower AC than the lich so smart characters will focus their attacks on the guardians to remove the lich's defenses.

**Protective Spells**: In its default state, the lich has access to _mirror image_ and _globe of invulnerability_. These two spells can protect the lichsignificantly. A good lich likely has some sort of contingency in place to cast these spells before the battle begins. Keep in mind that _globe of invulnerability_ can be a drag for spellcasting characters who aren't likely to be able to land any spell on it. Use with care. _Globe of invulnerability_ also has the big advantage of preventing _counterspell_. We might, however, replace it with _greater invisibility_ which makes the lich harder to hit and impossible to target but doesn't stop all spells outright.

**Permanent Flight**. You might also consider giving the lich a permanent use of _fly_. This can help the lich stay out of range of powerful melee attackers who would otherwise make short work of the lich.

**Magic Items**: Lich's have had centuries to amass powerful magic items and there's no reason the lich won't use them in combat. Some good magic items include a staff of power which gives the lich +2 to AC, saving throws, and spell attacks and black robes of the archmagi which gives the lich an AC to 18, +2 to DCs and spell attacks, and advantage on saving throws. There's really no way anyone will land a spell on him now and his armor class with these two items is a flat 20 before shield.

**_Write These Changes Down!_**: Write down these new abilities and stat changes on a sticky note and stick it onto the page with his stats so you don't forget. It's easy to forget all of this stuff when you're in the thick of combat. Review it before the fight and keep it in front of you during the fight.

## Action Checklist

Lich's have tons of options but only a few actions in which to use them. We need to be careful how we spend those actions. A lich's actions breaks down into five categories: legendary actions, lair actions, reactions, and main actions. The lich doesn't have any bonus actions to consider.

With so many options and action types, it helps if we keep a general checklist in mind when the lich is in combat. Here's one such checklist:

-   For legendary actions, fire _rays of frost_ at whoever you want. There are no bad targets for this spell. Remember that _ray of frost_ does 18 (4d8) damage on a it. Use _paralyzing touch_ if stuck in melee with a character. It can follow up with a _disintegrate_ on its turn if a target is paralyzed, getting a free hit for 73 damage.
-   For lair actions rotate between the damage tether and the attacking apperations on low constitution characters.
-   For reactions, be ready to either _counterspell_ spells that can get past _legendary resistance_ but still disrupt the lich's evil plans. Remember a lich can counter a _counterspell_ on their turn if someone tries to _counterspell_ the lich's big action spell.
-   For primary actions, stick to big impactful spells like _finger of death_, _disintegrate_, and _power word kill_. If you're willing to give it access to other spells it may use _meteor swarm_, _prismatic spray_, _chain lightning_, or _circle of death_.

## Maximizing Damage

If you want a true deadly lich, an easy way to do it is to maximize their damage output. Now they do 32 damage with a _ray of frost_, 100 damage with a _disintegrate_, 86 damage with a _finger of death_, 60 damage on a _prismatic spray_, 80 damage with a _chain lightning_, 90 damage with the attacking apperations, and so on. That will get the attention of just about any party of adventurers.

## Making the Lich Fun to Fight

All of the above actions are designed to make the lich as dangerous as possible. Against an experienced group of players running powerful characters, this might be perfectly acceptable. You'll have to gauge the power of the characters and the experience and desires of the players before you decide to wipe them all out with a super-smart lich. If you're running the lich against less experienced players, _fireball_, _lightning bolt_, and _cone of cold_ might be better options than _power word kill_ and _disintegrate_. Just because a lich _can_ wipe the party out doesn't mean it _should_. Fighting a lich should push any group of players right to the edge.

In general it's more fun for players if they take damage than if their characters are either killed outright or taken out of the fight with spells like _force cage_, _feeblemind_, _maze_, or the like.

## Test Your Lich

The changes we've made to the lich in this article may very well increase its challenge rating. Challenge ratings are hard to gauge at high levels anyway, however, so it's not something we should spend much time worrying about. Instead, **test your lich** by throwing similar creatures at the characters to see how easily they handle them. The lich may use the _simulacrum_ of itself to test the characters before they face the true lich. Of course, the lich's philactery makes it particularly difficult to kill. It's possible, even likely, that the chararacters will have to face the lich multiple times before defeating it. The lich will certainly learn from the experience.

## Six Minds Against One

We DMs face a strong tactical disadvantage. We have but one brain and, when we're running a significant challenge in our adventures, we face four to six other brains. It's hard for us to manage running the game, facilitating the story, keeping the spotlight moving and focused, ensuring everyone's having a good time, and run a creature like a lich all at the same time. Spend time studying your boss monsters so when you run them they will bring a fun challenge to the group.
