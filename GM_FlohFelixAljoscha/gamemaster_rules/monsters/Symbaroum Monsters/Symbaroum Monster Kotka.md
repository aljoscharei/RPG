Tactics Kotkas tend to hunt in pairs or groups of three adults; they usually sneak up on herds of prey and work together to isolate a single target. They do the same when facing a group of enemies – they focus on one target at a time, trying to gain an Advantage through flanking mo- vements. Naturally, they will attack the largest, most tough-looking opponent first.
