Stench. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the gwann must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the crea- ture is immune to the gwann’s stench for 24 hours.

Tunneler. If the gwann leaves a creature’s reach by burrowing it does not provoke an opportunity attack.

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage.

Sinkhole (Recharge 5–6). The gwann burrows directly at the feet of a creature, creating a 10-foot diameter hole. Each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the hole, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and becoming prone 20 feet beneath the ground’s surface.

Reactions

Death Blow. When the gwann is reduced to 0 hit points it splays out its claws in a death seizure. If the attacker is within 5 feet of the gwann, make a Claws attack roll against the attacker with disadvantage.
