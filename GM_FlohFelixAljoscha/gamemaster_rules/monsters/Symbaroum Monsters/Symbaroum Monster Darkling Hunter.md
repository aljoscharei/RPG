Tactics The darklings fight unhindered by dark- ness and hunt in groups, commanded by a strong leader. Aside from defending the leader, they aim for the target he or she has appointed. If the oppo- sition seems tough the leader may give the order to retreat, but they will not be taken alive and if someone in their group cannot get away they all stay and fight to the death
