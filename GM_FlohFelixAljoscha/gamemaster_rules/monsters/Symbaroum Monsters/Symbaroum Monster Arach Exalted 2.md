[[202201311237 Monster Lasifor Angathal Taar Spinnenlich]]
The thread that’s been spun has beginning, has end, but never ceases to be. The thread that’s been ended still remains, forever bound to existence – essential, unbroken, unchanging. If end is merged with end, beginning is void, end is void, and that which ended becomes eternal. So shall happen, one day, to Angathal Taar, our sovereign and lord of the world.

Spider Climb. Arach exalted can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.  

Web Sense. While in contact with a web, the arach exalted knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.  

Web Walker. The arach exalted ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

 
 

### Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage and the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature takes 18 (4d8) poison damage at the start of its turn and can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effects on a success. 

Web (Recharge 5–6). Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: The creature is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 14 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect also ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.


### Legendary Actions
- The arach exalted can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The arach exalted regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
	- Command. The arach exalted can select another arach which takes its turn next, instead of at its normal initiative count. This effect lasts for only one round.
	- Attack. The arach exalted can make a bite attack
	- Recharge (Costs 2 Actions). The arach exalted automatically recharges its web feature.

###   Lair Action. 
**Harmful Aura**: If the arach exalted is within its territory, it can, on initiative count 20 (losing all ties) release tiny hairs into the air, causing irritation to creatures’ within 60 feet of it. Arachs and spiders are not affected by the hairs. Other creatures must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn. On a failure, the irritation is equivalent to the character being [[202202102011 5e Conditions Poisoned]] until the beginning of its next turn. An arach exalted cannot use this lair action if it is incapacitated or otherwise can’t take actions. If surprised, it can’t use it until after its first turn in the combat.
