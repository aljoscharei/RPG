Backstab (1/turn). the pickpocket deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when it hits a target with a melee weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the pickpocket that isn’t incapacitated and the pick- pocket doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Cunning Action. On each of its turns, the pickpocket can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disen- gage, or Hide action.

Evasion. If the pickpocket is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the pickpocket instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

Actions

Stiletto. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 $., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. Deep impact: a critical hit with this weapon does a to- tal of 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage (plus backstab damage if applicable).

Reactions

Acrobatic Fighter. the pickpocket can make a Dex- terity (Acrobatics) check with the attack roll as the DC to take half damage from an attack on a success.
