Wild boars are not a rare sight for travelers in Davokar, es- pecially not out east in the territory of clan Vajvod where they are hunted for meat and tusks. It is also the Vajvods who have fostered the tradition of once a year, during winter when the snow makes tracking an easy task, sending a group of select warriors deep into Davokar, hunting the Aboar.

This mythical giant swine is said to be related to the liege trolls and even outshines them when it comes to both cleverness and brutality. Only on a couple of occasions have there been credible reports of villages, outposts or travelers that have been attacked by an aboar – maybe be- cause all potential witnesses have died in other attacks. On the other hand, it is far from unusual to hear farmers and others who work close to Davokar tell of strange hap- penings; occasions when they all of a sudden have found themselves being watched by some staring aboar, standing still at the forest edge or somewhere out on their farmlands. And none of the storytellers have the slightest doubt that a calculating and rational intellect hides behind the mon- strous hog’s wrinkled forehead.

Tactics. The Aboar uses diversion attacks to try to scare the enemy away from its territory; if that fails the giant boar trusts that its tusks, reflexes and thick hide are enough to plow down any aggressor.
