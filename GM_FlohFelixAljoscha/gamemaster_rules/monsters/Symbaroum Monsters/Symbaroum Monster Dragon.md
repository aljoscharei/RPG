Tactics Even if the fully evolved dragon has lost its capability to enthrall it has many tactics to choose from in combat. If the resistance is challenging, it rises into the air and makes sweeping attacks with bites and fire. At other times, it opts to meet the ene- my on the ground, and then draws extra power from the wisdom of its ancestors (for instance the ability Berserker or Feat of Strength at adept level)
