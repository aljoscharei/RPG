Tactics After having created four mirror images of itself, the Glimmer attacks from behind, surpri- sing the target and scaring them mad by projec- ting their own fears right back at them. Fighting the Glimmer is like combating sunbursting shreds and glimmering rays in an otherwise black vortex of nightmarish apparitions.

surprise and Sanctuary

About 50 meters from the Post, streams of sunlight dance off the surface of the lake, as if cutting through the cloud, catching the eyes of the cha- racters – but there is no break in the cloud. The Glimmer has emerged, drawn by the presence of the travelers, frustrated by the inability to reach those hiding within the Post.

Fighting the Glimmer feels like striking out at many enemies while facing into the blinding light of the sun, things only half seen snatching and striking. The presence of the abomination invokes an inexplicable sense of dread.

If someone runs for the Post, the door will open at the last moment of approach and no sooner. Within the tower, the player characters will find a scene of squalor and despair, a dozen desperate and weakened survivors of the caravan, all suffering from dehydration for lack of water. Half of them are asleep, too tired to do anything else.

The most vital and vocal are Birtas, a barbarian warrior, and Aranja, a preacher. Birtas feels certain that their assailant is an abomination, a creature of corruption, and that there must be a source that can be stemmed or destroyed. Aranja fears that the avenging light has come as a manifestation of the ill-will of Prios toward the faithless. Both explain that members of the caravan they journeyed with have disappeared, vanished during the attack that assaulted their cara- van or walked off during the night. Among the lost are, of course, any individual that the characters may have come looking for, for instance Bergo or Fortha.

Before exploring further, the travelers will welcome the sharing of supplies, the acquisition or offering of clean water, and any offer of healing assistance. With any attempt to revive the occupants of the Post, the player characters may get assistance from those travelers who have remained consci- ous, including the three named caravan members. Otherwise they will struggle, weak from their forced imprisonment. The players can make use of the named characters as assistance, but without supplies they make all tests with a second chance to fail.
