Corruption

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nYCeICNVofayFr6tsOe4TTROFOZUx5fD_6m6g9ksc1Y/edit#gid=0&range=A239](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nYCeICNVofayFr6tsOe4TTROFOZUx5fD_6m6g9ksc1Y/edit#gid=0&range=A239)




## Description
However far the Corruption has gone, the blight-born are still recognizable for what they once were – human, ogre, troll or mare cat. But there are also scarce reports describing something else; something worse and more unnatural; creatures so alien and so hateful that they appear to embody the exact opposite of nature. It is speculated as to whether or not these primal horrors truly exist and if they in that case could be embodiments of the Corruption itself; personifications of the hunger and the hatred and the wrath.

Among the barbarians there is a long list of legends about Primal Blight Beasts and their origins. Most of them describe the abominations as born out of the marrow of something called the World Serpent, a mystical beast that according to some tales created Symbaroum. Others state that it was slain by Symbaroum’s first emperor or that it still bides its time somewhere under the high seat of Symbar. A totally different take on the origins of the primal horrors, is that they appear spontaneously in places where the Corruption is at its strongest – in the ruins brooding on the darkest secrets, where puddles of acidic magic remain from the baneful practices of Symbaroum. Whatever the truth may be, both Ambrians and barbarians can count themselves lucky that the primal horrors prefer the dark depth of the forest instead of the sun-drenched lowlands.
