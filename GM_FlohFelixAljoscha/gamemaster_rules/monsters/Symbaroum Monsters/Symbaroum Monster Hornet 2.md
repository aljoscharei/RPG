Swarm. the swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. the swarm can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

Swarm Growth. If the hornet swarm is within 5 feet of another hornet swarm, the two can combine to- gether, adding their current hit points together. If the two swarms had different initiative counts, the combined swarm gains the lower initiative count.

Actions

Stings. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 0 $., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage or 1 piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. If the target is a creature it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be- come stunned until the end of its next turn.

Reactions

Divide. If the hornet swarm takes damage it can divide itself into two swarms, each with half of the original swarm’s current hit points (negating the damage). these smaller swarms do 1 point of piercing damage (along with the saving throw against their stunning poison) and cannot divide.
