Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage and the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become [[202202102011 5e Conditions Poisoned]] for 1 minute. A poisoned creature takes 4 (1d8) poison damage at the start of its turn and can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effects on a success.

**Web** (Recharge 5–6). Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 40/80 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit:
The creature is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 13 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect also ends if the webbing is destroyed.
