Tactics Dashes silently towards the weakest targets aiming to poison them, and counts on the Intruder daemons to come to their aid if the prey proves to be tougher than expected. As soon as the poison takes effect, they start moving around to double the effect of their protection.

## Description:
From the still pools of blighted sludge which sometimes come bubbling up through the cracks of the Underworld, the insectoid Chasm Stag is born – the size of a fox, but covered in a hard shell and as ravenous as other abominations. They often move in groups of three to five individuals, but even a single beetle can cause great problems, as the Intruder Daemons of the Yonderworld seem to find them valuable and worth protecting.
