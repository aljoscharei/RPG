Captivate. The blood cat uses its bonus action and stares at a single creature with its wide yellow eyes. The creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.

Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 16).

Drain Blood. If the blood cat has a creature grappled it can drain that creature’s blood, doing 10 (3d6) necrotic damage to the creature.

reActions

Acrobatic Fighter. When an attack roll is successful, the blood cat makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check using the attack roll result as the DC. On a success, it takes half damage from that attack.
