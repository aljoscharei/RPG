The fey beast is one of the most ferocious, unwav- ering predators in the region. In terms of physical shape and constitution, it resembles a jakaar or a large dog, but its gray or brown speckled fur is definitely feline. Like mare cats, the fey beast has a venomous gland right above its fangs, but while the mare cat’s venom is lethal, the fey beast’s will only paralyze the victim. And that is precisely what makes it such a fearsome predator: you can hardly spend a day in Thistle Hold without hearing stories of people who have been eaten, alive and conscious.

Tactics Fey beasts hunt in packs, and would rather not attack unless they outnumber their prey by at least two-to-one. Together they hunt down the victims, and when all victims have been paralyzed, the feast begins.
