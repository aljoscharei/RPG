Mystical Connection. Nefarani are in constant psychic contact with each other. Each individual has advantage on attack rolls as long as another conscious nefarani is within 5 feet of the same enemy.

 
Might From the Fallen. When a nefarani falls, the following events occur: each nefarani (regardless   of distance) gains a Hit Die and its current and maximum hit points are increased by 10 (1d8 + 5); each nefarani increases one attribute score by 1 point (adjusting any modifiers and derived values as needed); each nefarani screams out the name of the fallen; each non-nefarani creature that can hear the screaming must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of all nefarani. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success. (Every second time this occurs, the creatures’ challenge rating should increase by one step, possibly chang- ing the nefarani’s proficiency bonus.)
