Baiagorn

The bear-like baiagorn is not very big, nor very strong but is instead one of the most ferocious fighters of the woods. Typically it wanders alone but is not afraid to attack prey animals that are significantly bigger than itself; it never runs from danger and thanks to its hot temper it often emerges victorious from even the toughest fight.  
The Baiaga clan, which has taken its name from these hot-headed bear beasts, has developed a method for taming baiagorns and teaching them some level of control. Paired with a skilled human fighter a baiagorn can be most effective – the beast attacks and absorbs the first hits while the barbarian hangs back waiting for the enemy to expose a weak spot. But a lone bear is hardly enough to pose a threat to a skilled warrior; for that a she-bear with a handful of yearlings is probably needed.

Tactics. A calm baiagorn is a careful creature, but if agitated or wounded it transforms into a roaring, foaming storm of claws that attacks its closest enemy or prey.
