## 3 Round Combat Plan

 

Large humanoid (Troll)

 

**Armor Class** 14 (skins)  
**Hit Points** 149 (13d10 + 78, tough) 
**Speed** 30 ft.

 

| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA    |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 20 (+5) | 15 (+2) | 20 (+5) | 13 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 9 (−1) |

 

**Skills** Athletics +9, Intimidation +3, Perception +5 **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15 
**Languages** Barbarian, Troll languages  
**Challenge** 10 (5,900 XP, proficiency bonus +4) 
**Manner** bossy, fearless
**Shadow** deep red, with streaks of rust (Corruption: 2/7)
**Equipment** crude alchemical equipment, weak poison, weak antidote, jewelry and trinkets (1d10 thaler)

 

**Rage** (3/day). As a bonus action, the troll can enter a rage that lasts for 1 minute. While in the rage, the troll has advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. When it makes a melee weapon attack it adds +4 to its damage. The creature has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage while in the rage. The rage ends early if the creature ends its turn without having attacked a hostile creature since its last turn or taken damage since then. It can also use a bonus action to end the rage.

**Regeneration**. The liege troll recovers 9 hit points at the start of its turn, unless it has taken acid or fire damage since its last turn.

**Tough**. The liege troll has 1 extra hit point for each Hit Die it has.

# Actions

**Multiattack**. The troll makes two claw attacks. Each grappled creature (see below) prevents the troll from making a claw attack.

**Claw**. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage.

**Grab and Squeeze**. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[202202102004 5e Conditions Grappled]] (escape DC 19). The troll can have a maximum of two creatures grappled. On subsequent rounds, it can use its action to do 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage to a target.
