Tactics If some prey-animal passes within melee range, the shrub tries to envelop it in a crushing embrace, otherwise it sends out its grappling vines to pull the mouth-watering target close. Should it be attacked from a distance, it can re- taliate as long as the target is within the distance of two movement actions (see Grappling Tongue).
