Alchemical Weapons. the Panzer alchemist is trained in alchemical weapons.

Backstab (1/turn). the Panzer alchemist deals an extra 28 (8d6) damage when it hits a target with a melee or alchemical weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the creature that isn’t incapacitated and the creature doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Enduring March. the Panzer alchemist has advan- tage on saving throws against exhaustion.

Noisy. While wearing its armor the Panzer alchemist has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Siege Expert. the Panzer alchemist is trained in siege equipment and its attacks do double dam- age against structures.

Actions

Firetube (Portable). When the Panzer alchemist fires the tube, each creature in a 20-foot cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking half damage on a success. the damage is based on the powder loaded: Bang: 5 (1d10) thunder; Burning: 6 (1d12) fire; Flash: 3 (1d6) fire + the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. If the Panzer alchemist uses the firetube as a melee weapon, it is +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage.

Reactions

Two-handed Force. If the Panzer alchemist misses a melee attack, it can reroll the attack.
