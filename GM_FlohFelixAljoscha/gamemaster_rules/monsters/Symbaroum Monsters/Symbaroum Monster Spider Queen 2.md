**Spider Climb.** Spider queens can climb difficult sur- faces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
**Summon Children** (1/day). The spider queen can summon its choice of three fray spiders, six etterherd swarms, six hunting spiders, or two [[Symbaroum Monster Tricklesting]]. The spiders arrive at the end of the queen’s next turn.

**Web Sense**. While in contact with a web, a spider queen knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The spider queen ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

Actions

**Multiattack**. The spider queen makes two bite or two poison spit attacks.

**Bite**. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) piercing damage and the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become [[202202102007 5e Conditions Paralyzed]] for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature takes 4 (1d8) poison damage at the start of its turn and can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effects on a success.

**Poison Spit.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) poison damage. A character hit by the poison must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed until the end of its next turn.

**Web**. (Recharge 5–6). Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, range 40/80 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: The creature is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 15 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect also ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 15, 20 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.
