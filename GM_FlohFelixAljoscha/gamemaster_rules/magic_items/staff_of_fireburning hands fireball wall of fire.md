# Staff of Fire 
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_ 

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **_[[5e spells burning hands cone 3d6 dmg w not favoured]]_** (1 charge), **_[[5e spells lvl 3 evocation fireball 20 ft 8d6 Ruins not favoured w]]_** (3 charges), or **_[[5e spells wall of fire dmg outside w]]_** (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
