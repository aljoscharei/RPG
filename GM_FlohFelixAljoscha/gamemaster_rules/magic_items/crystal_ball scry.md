# Crystal Ball 
_Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)_ 

The typical **crystal ball**, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the **_[[scrying on creature wc not favoured]]_** spell (save DC 17) with it.

The following **crystal ball** variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

**Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.** You can use an action to cast the **_[[detect thoughts esp not favoured w]]_** spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the **crystal ball**, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this **_[[detect thoughts esp not favoured w]]_** to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if **_[[scrying on creature wc not favoured]]_** ends.

**Crystal Ball of Telepathy.** While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the **_[[suggestion mind control w not favoured]]_** spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this **_[[suggestion mind control w not favoured]]_** to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if **_scrying_** ends. Once used, the **_suggestion_** power of the crystal ball can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Crystal Ball of [[true seeing illusions wc]].** While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight[[the environment#^29754d]]   with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell's sensor.
