# Staff of Frost 
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_ 

You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **_[[5e Spells cone of cold 8d8 dmg w]]_** (5 charges), **_[[5e spells fog cloud w]]_** (1 charge), **_[[5e spells ice storm AoE Dmg w]]_** (4 charges), or **_wall of ice_** (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
