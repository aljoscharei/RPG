# Potion of Healing 
_Potion, rarity varies_ 

You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion's rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated. 

This is where they come from in Symbaroum: [[Ruins of Symbaroum Mystic Approach Self-taught Mystic]]. But only 1 hp each
