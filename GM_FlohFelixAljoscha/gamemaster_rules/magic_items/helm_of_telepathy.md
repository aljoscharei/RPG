# Helm of Telepathy 
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_ 

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the **_[[detect thoughts esp not favoured w]]_** spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply--using a bonus action to do so--while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with **_[[detect thoughts esp not favoured w]]_**, you can use an action to cast the **_[[suggestion mind control w not favoured]]_** spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the **_[[suggestion mind control w not favoured]]_** property can't be used again until the next dawn.
