# Circlet of Blasting 
_Wondrous item, uncommon_ 

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the **_[[5e spells scorching ray 3x2d6 dmg w]]_** spell with it. When you make the spell's attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of +5. The circlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
