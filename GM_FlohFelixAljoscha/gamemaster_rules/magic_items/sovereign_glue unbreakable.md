# Sovereign Glue 
_Wondrous item, legendary_ 

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with **[[oil_of_slipperiness]]**. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of **[[universal_solvent]]** or **[[oil_of_etherealness]]**, or with a **_[[wish universal w not favoured]]_** spell.
