Throwing Grenades

When you throw a grenade, you can either aim for a creature, in which case the to-hit roll is against its AC, or aim for a specific spot on the ground which is AC 13. On a failure the grenade lands somewhere else: roll 1D8 for cardinal direction (1 = north, 2 = north-east, 3 = east, etc.) and 1d10 for distance in feet and explodes.
