A member of an expedition acting as a sentinel can make Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect threats or notice anything else out of the ordinary.

> _Design Note: If you use passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, their use on journeys is also limited to sentinels._ [_I do not._](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/40309/roleplaying-games/rulings-in-practice-perception-type-tests)

**Advanced Rule – Outrider**: During a travel watch, a character can journey out in an effort to protect the expedition from detection or threats. Whenever an encounter is generated for the expedition, each outrider group can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 15 or opposed by the encounter’s Stealth check) to detect the encounter before it’s encountered by the expedition.

However, an additional encounter check is also made for each outrider group at one-half the normal chance of an encounter. (It’s possible for outriders to discover locations or encounter creatures which would have otherwise been missed by the main expedition.)
