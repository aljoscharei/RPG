Distribute these Hoards per Level into 4 Parcels per level and distribute them. The level of the Treasure should be the CR of the place where Treasure is found. If level 20 PCs chase rats in the cellar, the get 20 GP.

### When Assuming Treasure Hoards, how to distribute them?
#### Big Pile

Award all treasure hoards in the final level of the tier.

This is an outright terrible idea. Players will go through huge stretches with no treasure greater than the change rattling around in enemy pockets, and wonâ€™t get new magic items for long periods until suddenly they find a pile of them in some dungeon or something and experience a sudden and confusing leap in power.

#### Flat Distribution

Distribute the hoards evenly over the level tier.

This is a perfectly fine way to do things, but it has some warts. Entering a new tier comes with a sudden and significant jump in the value and power of treasure which players find. Toward the end of the tier treasure feels lackluster because players are getting the same quantity of treasure that they recieved several levels prior.

#### Ramp

Distributes hoards such that each level has more hoards than the previous level.
