The court’s original formation revolved around a particular duty or role that has long since been forgotten. This may be a metaphorical forgetting, like a idealistic young businessman turning to cold- hearted avarice, or it may be a literal loss of some ancient charge or consecrated role. This forgetting may have left the court with ancestral obligations they no longer understand, or resources they no longer use in the intended way.

5.  E  Leader wholly absorbed in their own ambitions, Outsider made hostile by the court’s failure to do their duty, Enemy who prospers by their forgetting
    
6.  F  Earnest historian who knows the truth, Last stubborn upholder of the role, Petitioner who needs them to do their old duty
    

C The purpose was a vile and terrible one, Their current prosperity depends on ignoring the purpose, The consequences of their forgetting are going to be dire

T Proof of their original purpose, Potent artifact meant to aid their role, Treasure once given to them in repayment for their work

P Forgotten chamber for the duty, Lost site of importance, Place damaged by the forgetting
