Resting at nearly 10,000 paces up in the mountains, the humble town of St. Oysingra was built to mine ore in the Old Empire days. It had remained a small mining outpost until the Cinder King arose and the Orite Alchemists discovered that it was a source of the Black Earth, which was needed for Black Shot transmutation. The mining town boomed once again, until the push of the undead three years ago reached it.

The same Eastern Kingdoms offensive that ended in the great Breaking also liberated the town. Now mostly a community of people from the Eastern Kingdoms, they have come to secure a valuable source of Black Earth for the war efforts. Food and mining supplies have been periodically arriving from the east—though few have been received in a while—and the caravan headed back with the last big shipment of Black Earth has not been heard from.

In the nearby cliffs lie several mountain drilling operations—a dense honeycomb of mines and minerals and industry. Old equipment lies abandoned for lack of people to drive them, while the few mines still open struggle to pull material out of the ground without collapses or worker shortages interrupting—a problem made more difficult by rumors of horrific creatures that still lurk in the mines.

The townsfolk here are optimistic of the Legion’s arrival—after all, they’ve heard stories of the Legion, and they are hungry for news 
from the front.

mission type: Assault favor: Mercy, Knowledge

Though the armies of the Eastern Kingdoms reopened the town, there have been undead plaguing the mountains since the Cinder King’s first advance. Clearing out the infestation would cover your back, and help with being hunted from multiple angles. GM: Choose an Infamous and an associated site that crafts undead from a Broken not in this campaign. The mission is to destroy this source of undead creation.

mission rewards: -2 Time. Pressure does not increase. +2 Morale. mission penalties: +1 Time.

mission type: Supply favor: Wild

The most lucrative Black Earth vein in the area has been shut down for months. Something has infested the lower parts of the mine, claiming a number of miners’ lives. The more credible accounts talk of the creature’s impossible number of legs, savage efficiency, and the persistent clicking sound that seems to presage its attack. If the monster could be killed, the mine could be reopened, and supplies refreshed.

mission rewards: +2 Supply. 1 Black Shot (3 uses). 1 Supply Cart. mission penalties: None.

Almost 300 years ago, Oysingra—a Chosen of the Living God—was entombed. She fought alongside Zora against the Last Emperor, but was horrifically wounded. Details of her death vary from being entombed alive to committing suicide. Regardless, her resting place is worth examining. GM: Oysingra is still alive, though weak and maddened (threat 3). She is attended by a squad of Zemyati revenant attendants (threat 2).

mission rewards: +1 Supply. Living God’s Blessing: Specialists and Soldiers on this mission gain an advance when Oysingra is laid to rest.

mission penalties: None.
