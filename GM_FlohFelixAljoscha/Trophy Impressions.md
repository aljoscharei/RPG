Small undulating loam hills.
Large wide sinkholes, now overgrown.
A bog full of twitching bloated corpses
A field of tiny splintered bones.
Chaotic mess of dirt piles and rotted logs.
Armor, weapons, skeletons from a long-forgotten battle.
Hundreds of burrows pepper the ground.
Ancient glacial boulder field.
An abbey, now decayed
The ruins of a camp, signs of violence.
Slow decline, dotted with fresh stumps.
A series of warm leisurely streams.
A cold fast moving creek.

Large cliff face packed with fresh wet clay.

The earth and stones here are ashen and break easily.
A bear graveyard.
Several bonfires smolder still.
A large stream disappears down into a hole.
The ground is naturally terraced.
Thick viscous mud oozes and is as warm as blood.
Two dessicated corpses sit across from each other atop a flat rock, the rotted remains of a picnic lunch laid out between them. Each has a hand placed in the other’s mouth, which is illed with a fistful of loamy soil.
A broad, shallow pond filled to capacity with foot-long koi, each with a thick, mottled coat of slimy, multi-colored moss covering it like fur.
An ancient but still-standing well of rough but carefully-fit moss-covered stones. A powerful smell of damp mold rises from it. Fat violet slugs line the inside stones where the sun does not fall.
The remains of a campsite atop a vast soft bed of turquoise moss. Ragged, rotting bits and pieces of tattered and trampled gear are scattered across it. A powerful smell of animal musk hangs in the air.
At the foot of a high waterfall, a cold river thunders down to form a large pool, the water tinted a soft dull green. Drinking it tastes like eating a fistful of ground-up grass, but it is not poisonous. The pool is filled with tiny, sickly, albino freshwater crawfish, their claws oversized and twisted.
A wide, shallow pool perhaps 60 feet across, filled to overflowing with clutches of frog eggs the size of robins’ eggs.
A handful of ancient practice dummies stand in ankle-deep bog. They have been impaled with rusting swords, rotting arrows, and splintered spears. Sprays of dark red moss grow from the “wounds” in a pattern reminiscent of bloodstains, as thick clouds of tiny crimson gnats hover around them.
A moss-covered wall of ancient stones, waist-high, extends in a jagged line in both directions, disappearing into the woods. The wall moans softly for a few moments if any stones are removed.
Three leather-armored corpses, their helms staved in, lie in the root cluster behind a huge tree drowning in Spanish moss. A massive, intricate spider web glistens between their bodies. Exactly 13, three-inch-long emerald green spiders scuttle along its strands.
The oddly-shaped arch that rises a score of feet over the trail is actually a pair of colossal antlers, overgrown with dull brown moss. Digging into the soil below the arch reveals a hard surface the color and consistency of bone.
The messily-decapitated head of an ancient, colossal statue lies face-up to the sky, half-sunken in the wet soil. Brackish, algae-scummed water fills its gaping mouth and pools in its eyes. A thick cloud of dragonflies, iridescent green and blue, copulate in mid-air as they flit above.
You hear a child singing sadly somewhere off the trail
A sequence of strangely-colored birds flit about the trees: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet
A sudden gust of wind shakes the forest, threatening to knock down trees
A diminutive, deformed face peeks through the brush, then disappears
Your foot kicks crumbled brick, proof that the path on which you walk was once paved
A dozen crows circle and flee
The remains of a man are tied to a tree, a clear warning to stay away
You see a half-finished log cabin ahead, a rusted ax abandoned in a stump
The roar of a large cat or bear rumbles some distance away
A small pocket of red poppies fill the air with their heady fragrance
The bark of a tree is knotted and warped as if a face in pain
Branches like fingers unfurl and stretch
A flock of winged imp-like creatures shriek through the canopy ahead
The structure gleams, light bouncing and reflecting off the emerald leaves
Thousands of dragonflies in torpor, attached to trees and tents A gentle humming sound, like a lullaby
A sudden warm breeze that smothers like a blanket
The cries of night animals (owls, frogs) during daylight hours
A bear in hibernation, unwakeable
A garden of stone statues, nothing in common but their closed eyes
A hole dug for a grave, left empty
A slow breathing, emanating from the earth itself
A fluttering form passes at the edge of your peripheral vision
Cricket chirps happen at increasingly greater intervals
Memorable trees and stones appear in the wrong location
Boots become heavy and walking slows, though the ground is not muddy
The moon appears through the forest canopy, though it should be daytime
A marker stone is discovered, covered with symbols evoking sleep
Stones used as head rests during camp are later identified as gravestones
Starved, emaciated dogs feast noisily and happily on what seems to be fresh corpses.
A wet, sticky fog that smells of rust and tastes of blood, engulfing your path.
The slow, rhythmic marching of boots on marshy ground, always just past the trees.
You hear the crying, snivelling, pleas of a warrior at death’s door in the distance.
A patch of land full of frozen, grasping hands poking from the dirt.
A row of graves, hastily dug—still fresh—with nothing but swords for headstones.
Trees sprouting from rusted armor, branches twisted to look like arms, bark curled into despairing faces.
A man recently dead, pinned to a tree by a storm of arrows, eyes gazing desperately at you.
The flowers hum marching tunes, songs to keep the spirits up in desperate times.
Carrion birds follow your every step, waiting for their next feast.
The sky is perpetually unseen, covered in a dry, colorless fog, twisting one’s perception of time.
A ditch of bones, bleached with age, skeletons trying to climb over each other.
A path is paved in broken swords and shields, blades sticking out of the ground.
The whistling of arrows passing close to your ear, close enough to have been a headshot.
Empty suits of armor litter the forest floor, reeking in rot, blooming in fungi.
Keep the hunters moving using aural phenomena: the snivelling of a wounded soldier dying, the cheerful rhythms of ghostly marching tunes just beyond the trees. Keep them guessing and reacting feverishly to each perceived threat.
