The territory of clan Odaiova spans between Karvosti and Thistle Hold, which means that the route between the two settlements traverses their grounds. Hence, one should not be surprised that the Odavs have gotten used to the Ambrian presence and learned to capitalize on it. It is often the people of Odaiova who act as intermediaries in contact and trade between Ambrians and barbarians, which means that the clan chieftain, Embersind, lives a much more comfortable life compared to other barbarian leaders.
