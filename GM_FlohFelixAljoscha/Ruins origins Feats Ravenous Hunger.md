If your current hit points are less than 1/4 of your maximum hit points (rounded down), you are overcome by an almost undeniable hunger. If you take your action to feast on raw flesh then you recover 1d4 plus your Constitution modifier in hit points. This effect ends when you start your turn with more than 1/4 of your maximum hit points and will not occur again until you take a short or longer rest.
