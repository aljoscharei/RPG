The Enoais are tree-people, living in tree-tops or in caverns carved out under the roots of giant pines. One example of the latter is the legendary village of Enovak, where clan chieftain Karona resides. The settlement comprises about fifty households and a marketplace, all situated under the towering pine which shares its name with the clan.
