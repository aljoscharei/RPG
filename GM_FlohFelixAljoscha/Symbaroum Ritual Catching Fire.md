In the final days of Symbaroum, it was not uncommon for careless humans to summon and lose control of powerful daemons. These could threaten to destroy entire regions before they were banished or willingly returned to the dark abyss – eventually forcing the humans to develop extreme countermeasures.

One such measure is the Catching Fire ritual. It is a suicide ritual that makes it possible for an individual to sacrifice his/her own life to save hundreds or even thousands of others. The values below replace or are added to the martyr’s own, but he or she will only live for one scene after the ritual has been performed. The martyr then suffers a terrible death, as the protection from his/her own flames diminishes and the poor soul slowly burns to cinders in tremendous agony.
