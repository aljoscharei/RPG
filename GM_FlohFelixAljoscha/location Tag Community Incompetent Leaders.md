The community is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pig- headed obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.

E Heir who is totally unsuited to their new rule, Disinterested ruler forced on them by their overlord, Charismatic ninny with ridiculous plans

F Deposed former leader, Desperate local elder, Victim of one of their bungled plans

C An outside rival is backing the fool, The idiot has tremendous institutional legitimacy, They provide a critical skill or ability unrelated to ruling

T Embezzled funds from a failed plan, Precious artifact lost through incompetence, Regalia of critical importance to the rulerâ€™s legitimacy

P Chaotic and ill-kept court, Site of abject disaster, Plaza full of grumbling locals
