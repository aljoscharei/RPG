There is a swarm of some dangerous beast in the area, whether it consists of a tide of minuscule vermin or a pack of magically-warped predators. Some of these swarms may serve more as environmental hazards than monsters to be fought; sweeping carpets of mutated radioactive fire ants might be something for the PCs to dodge rather than engage. If the beasts have some mundane value, they might have attracted suitably reckless interest from the locals.
