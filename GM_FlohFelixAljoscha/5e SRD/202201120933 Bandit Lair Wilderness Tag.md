- Bandits rule village Dungeon
- Basic Plot of [[202012242341 The Evils of Illmire v2]]

Bandits lair in this hex, which is presumably close enough to civilized lands to serve as a base for their operations. Not every bandit lair is a hidden cave; some operate out of subverted or cowed villages, others hide among remote monasteries, and some just camp in convenient glades long enough to rest, refit, and trade with black marketeers. It might be a seasonal lair as well, with local peasants turning bandit at certain profitable times of the year.

C They have a traditional prey and don’t usually rob others, They’re the degenerate remnants of a once-noble cause, They’re a confederacy of thieving groups that often quarrel

P Raucous glade full of drink and debauchery, Re- purposed estate, Makeshift palisaded camp
