![[The long road.png]]

This Old Empire road has long been neglected, with the blight and decay pushing in from the west. The road is exposed and winding, but is lined by ancient Empire warding pillars along its path. These pillars are filled with ancient protections that seem to be proof against the undead, stopping the blight from spreading where their line holds. But they are too few, and many are broken down and destroyed by simple age and lack of upkeep.

The glory days of the Empire long gone, the road’s fallen to disuse with lack of maintenance over the centuries, and Aldermark has not provided upkeep. Nature in the area is taking over, leading to sections where the road disappears and has to be found again. Needless to say, traveling too far from the protective pillars is fraught these days.

Weather on the plains is fickle. Sudden rainstorms and hail coming down from the mountains before the sun has even set force travelers to seek shelter early, and start their journeys even earlier.

Occasional villages crop up now and again—with meandering paths leading off the main road—but they’re never in sight of the road itself. These small enclaves are the home of distrustful communities, religious sects, or long- isolated clusters of farmsteads.

The baerngard of Aldenmark are famous for their massive strength and powerful jaws that can snap a man in half. When they feel the touch of age, they seek the Bruin Graveyard.

They must be captured, hidden away, or slain, with any fresh corpses burned.
