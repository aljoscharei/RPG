![[The maw.png]]

This expansive cave network was long ago used as part of a trade route to Skydagger Keep before a combination of natural hazards and cave-dwelling people made the passage too treacherous. Once a network of natural caves, many portions of the network have been expanded and worked over time. The path remains traversable, though the passage sometimes requires stooping over, and sometimes crosses through caves whose ceilings are so high that lanterns do not reach it. The Maw is a pit so deep you cannot hear anything thrown in hit bottom. The path wraps around its lip for several long hours.

Carved into the rock are huge pillars more ancient than the Old Empire, covered in a language lost to time. Occasional shrines pepper the sides of the road early on, with small gifts placed before them. Walls often glitter with beautiful mineral deposits, and fungal outcroppings that have grown among the stone give the path an eerie quality both natural and civilized.

The path can be difficult to follow, and becoming lost can mean death once food and light run out. Found about are wrecked carriages of failed attempts to traverse from years ago, and more recent ones of folks who attempted to escape the war this way.

Deeper off the path live Pale Crawlers—a reclusive society of people who resent intrusion on their land, and look for opportunities to harass those who would trespass through their caves. Little is known about them. Though not blind, they scar their bodies and identify each other through touch in the dark. Their expertise with fungal venoms is second to none. Only underestimate them at great peril.

mission type: Religious favor: Holy, Knowledge

While most of the script on the cave walls remains indecipherable, some is recognizable to religious scholars in the Legion. It speaks of the tomb of a pre-Empire hero who wielded lightning—a Chosen from an era little is known about. Brave the tomb’s traps and guards, and fetch the corpse to make into Reliquaries.

mission rewards: 1 Religious Supplies (3 uses). Relic: Lightning Chain. (Mark 2 corruption to throw lightning at a nearby target, and reveal to Breaker who you are, where you are, and what you’re doing.)

mission penalties: None.

mission type: Assault favor: Mercy

The Pale Crawlers can be addressed head-on. Scouts tracked some of them deeper into the caves. They sortie from a giant cave that is host to a giant milky white serpent (threat 4) that glows with a pale luminescence. The Pale Crawlers feed intruders to this creature. If you can put it down or appease its hunger, the Pale Crawlers would pull back, giving the Legion much needed breathing room. Requires: Vital, Only Specialists

mission rewards: -2 Time. +3 Morale.

mission penalties: +2 Pressure if you attempt but fail, but no penalties if not attempted.

mission type: Assault favor: Glory, Mercy

The route through the caves merges to a single passage at one point—a vast cavern known as the Hall of Kings. This means that you know where a Broken chasing you must pass through to continue. A volunteer group should place and detonate charges on the supporting pillars to collapse the cave around the Broken, taking them out or burying them until long after the war is decided. Requires: Vital, Explosives

mission rewards: +5 Morale. -3 Time. mission penalties: None.
