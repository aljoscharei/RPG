![[Eastlake.png]]

Eastlake is a city that defines itself by its rivalry with Westlake. Whereas Westlakers show devotion through building churches, Eastlakers consider themselves more devout—their council is all anointed church folk and their mayor a deacon, which assures them they are far less corrupt and prone to graft. Where Westlakers channel trade from the coast, Eastlakers pride themselves on trade with the Eastern Kingdoms—the resounding bells that tell the time and raise alarms to the whole city are gifts from Or, who was allowed to build a temple to the Maker in town after promising such a wonder to the city.

Though Eastlake is seen as more refined and cosmopolitan, there is still an air of haughtiness. They are at their heart consumers, appreciating what others offer, but only from the stance of their own superiority.

So far, the war has left Eastlake relatively untouched, but a pall hangs over the city. Fires can be seen across the lake to the west. Rumors of undead pushing hard across the northern plains only compounds the fact that refugees have ceased to stream in from the south and east. The few words that come from the east say that a powerful undead force is at the border of Panya, burning the mythical forest as it advances.

For now, the citizens of Eastlake remain paralyzed, caught between a horde on either side, but so far untouched by the undead. There’s considerable debate about how to handle the situation, with some advocating for escape to the north, some arguing for a military response, and the majority wanting to wait, see, and trust in the gods.

mission type: Religious favor: Holy, Mercy, Mystic

Against the Cinder King’s orders, a Broken has encouraged some people to start worshiping the Cinder King’s “divine nature.” Calling themselves the Cult of Smoke, they perform rituals to ingest undead flesh so they can be “Chosen” by this false god. GM: Mission starts as blight signs in the city. Play out the search. Some of the cultists are badly blighted and count as threat 2/3 monstrosities.

mission rewards: -2 Pressure. +1 Intel (info on the Broken). +2 Morale.

mission penalties: Two Legionnaires go missing (two deaths).

A Bartan corporal and her warband were pinned down while pushing east to join the defensive line at Panya. They are now beset by forces from the front and won’t last the night. You need to slip through the undead lines, support the warband, and punch back through to get back to the city. (Bring two squads on this mission and expect heavy losses.) Requires: Horses

mission rewards: +2 Morale. 4 Soldiers. 1 Bartan Soldier (+2 actions, +1 special ability).

mission penalties: None.

mission type: Religious favor: Holy, Knowledge, Mystic

Many gods have Chosen before; Reliquaries are remains of those divine-touched bodies. The head of a former Chosen of Vazara was so preserved—it is still infused with divine knowledge and able to answer questions. It’s hidden in a monastery a long day’s ride from the city. The Mercy Damodi has been guarding the head in the catacombs, unwilling to risk transport—the head is mystically connected somehow to Breaker.

mission rewards: 1 Mercy. Relic: Head of a Chosen. (It must answer a question truthfully once per session. It may lie more often.)

mission penalties: None.
