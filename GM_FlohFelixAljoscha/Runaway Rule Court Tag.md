Out of overwork, sloth, or carelessness, the court has devolved much of its authority on some subsidiary group or power, leaving it to do the dirty work of a critical function. That group has seized control of that authority, however, and now bids fair to claim leadership of the court itself using its newfound leverage.

E Ambitious leader of the lesser group, Indolent and careless ruler, Greedy minister profiting by the devolution

F Client suffering due to the subsidiary’s actions, Minister robbed of effective power by the group, People being oppressed by the group’s excesses

C The group has considerable outside backing, The group really is doing something critical to the court’s function, The court is now actually incapable of handling the group’s duties

T Wealth obtained by the group’s actions, Treasure given to the group originally to induce them, Powerful relic obtained by the group as a tool

P Structure dedicated to the group’s devolved duty, Country estate of the group’s leader, Abandoned structure of the court that once handled it
