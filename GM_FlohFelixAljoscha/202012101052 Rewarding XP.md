# Planning Rewards and Consequences
https://rpgbot.net/dnd5/dungeonmasters/campaign_planning/#the-skeleton
This article clearly answers several questions about 5th edition and its underlying math:

-   How many encounters should players face at each level?
-   How much gold should I give my players at each level?
-   How many magic items should I give my players at each level?
-   How many in-game days does it take to reach level 20?

## Assumptions

The remainder of this article relies on a handful of assumptions. Tweaking these assumptions will result in changes to the “skeleton” which we will be building in this article.

### Experience Points

The campaign skeleton will assume that you are awarding experience points rather than using “Milestone Leveling” or some other system. This means that players will need a certain number of encounters of CR equal to their level worth of experience to gain a level.

This is one of the easier assumptions to change. You can use the campaign skeleton to get an idea of the number of encounters to include, then abandon experience points altogether, thereby achieving more flexibility in encounter design without altering the pace of the game.

### Default Random Treasure

The Dungeon Master’s Guide includes rules for random treasure. These rules don’t account for games with varying levels of magic, and they assume that you are using magic items in your game. We will make the same assumption because the majority of Dungeons and Dragons campaigns include magic items.

If you don’t want to use magic items in your game, remove them. 5th edition is balanced to be played without magic items, so this shouldn’t have any further effect on the campaign skeleton.

### 4-Player Party

The math for CR assumes that a single creature is an average-difficulty encounter for four player characters. Therefore, the rules for treasure assume that the treasure is divided among four characters. I’ll attempt to break this down into individual treasure to allow the campaign skeleton to scale up and down for parties of different sizes, but some amount of rounding will be required.

### The Adventuring Day and Short Rests

Page 84 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide describes “The Adventuring Day”. This establishes a rough guideline for how many encounters players can handle in any given day, and suggests roughly two short rests per day. These assumptions give us a guideline for how much adventuring you can squeeze into a single day, which in turn tells us how quickly you could expect to run players from level 1 to level 20 if you were to do nothing but adventure as quickly as possible.

### Gaining a Level Requires a Long Rest

While there is no rules guidance on the subject, I’m going to assume that you require players to complete a long rest before gaining a level. Gaining a level without taking a long rest introduces a lot of very complicated math that I don’t find interesting or meaningful.

## A Big Pile of Math

If you want to just trust me and ignore all of this interesting and useful math, skip to The Skeleton I won’t think any less of you, But if you want to understand the math and logic behind how I built the skeleton, settle in for some math, statistics, and tables full of numbers.

### How Many Encounters Per Level?

The table below includes the math to determine how many encounters of average CR will bring a player to the next level. Based on our assumptions discussed above, this assumes a party of four characters facing encounters made solely on single monsters of CR equal to the players’ level. This math largely disregards experience from other sources, but it tells us enough that we can build the skeleton.

The table reveals some really interesting information:

-   The number of encounters per level is almost never round. It’s hard to know why this is the case, but if I had to guess it’s because Wizards chose nicely rounded numbers for the experience to reach the next level without directly considering how much experience an encounter would grant.
-   The number of encounters per level ramp up significantly at 3rd level once characters are established and have all selected subclasses, then drop to 8-9 encounters per level at 11th level, likely because encounters become more complex at the beginning of Tier 3.
-   The daily experience budget allows roughly 5-6 encounters per day at every level except 5th, which allows more than 9. [[leveling up Proficiency Bonus#XP Valley]]
-   It will take a total of roughly 200 encounters worth of experience to bring a character to 20th level.
-   It will take just over 33 days for players to reach 20th level if you allow leveling in the middle of a day.

# XP and session planning
one can assume one combat encounter per session. If you assume the  [[encounters per level]], a campaign from level 1-20 takes 178 - 207 encounters. This means a campaign of combat because this is what players are rewarded for.

Alternatively you can use [[DmDavid]]s method of awarding [[DMDavid XP for Discovery]] which is spelled out in [[202012101039 Using Experience Points To Make DnD More Compelling]], you can assume more XP-Award per session and thus faster levelling.

![[202012101039 Using Experience Points To Make DnD More Compelling#XP for Discovery Table]]

# XP and in-game time
this is very weird. The default system leads to becoming a god in 30 days.
The XP-System does not help a bit to create a believeable in-game time for learning
Top Down: What time to become a god would I assume? maybe 30 years?
Bottom up: If I assume the rules for [[Training]] for each class feature, this would roughly mean a year per level.
