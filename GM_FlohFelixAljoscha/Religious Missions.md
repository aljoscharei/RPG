RELIGIOUS MISSIONS

Religious missions are about culture, typically in a religious context. These missions are often a way to showcase the world or its history.

In a religious mission, ask: Whose culture is this part of? Is this from Aldermark, one of the Eastern Kingdoms, or a legacy of the Old Empire?

How does that culture display its faith?

Mission objectives should be about recovery of religiously significant things, practice of religious rituals, restoration of past glories, and protecting the faith and practices of the people. The objectives are almost never about engaging with the enemy. They are about finding historically important or culturally significant assets, and unexpected allies tied to such elements. Of all the mission types, religious missions are probably the most varied in both design and objectives.

religious mission types

Religious missions are about performing one of the following, or protecting people who are doing such things.

- Escort: Someone holy or significant must be brought safely to or from a place.
- Cleansing: A holy place is befouled and must be purified, which may include performing a ritual or simply driving out the undead occupying it. This may also require finding an object or place that might fix a befouling (recovering holy waters that might cure a disease, or a wound your Chosen got in a battle with the Broken recently).
- Defense: Something of cultural significance must be protected from the corrupting influence of the undead.
- Unearth: A valuable artifact or historical object must be unearthed to serve use in the war.
- Favor: This mission will grant the selected mission favor and should incorporate that favorâ€™s themes and elements.
