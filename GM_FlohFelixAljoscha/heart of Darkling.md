	When strange plague struck the Archons of the Temple of Ilunezor the Bronze Collared, their curative magics failed them but their auguries showed of a place south of the temple where a small underground spring and stream was found to have the cure for their illness.
	
	Over the years afterwards, the location of the curative underground spring was dug out and stairs were added down into the lower cave and then up to the small cave where the spring originated.
	
	With the destruction of the temple, the Archon’s Climb became known instead as the Restless Hollow – named either after the burbling stream down below or according to some tales after the lone guardian of the cave who has lived among the mushrooms for so long that he now looks like a massive collection of fungus wandering the cave aimlessly.
	
	No one would care either way, except that the sage in town will tell you the only way to truly break the curse that the party rogue is under is to bathe him in the spring waters of the Restless Hollow…
	
	As always with most of my isometric works, I have a hard time making unusually shaped areas feel like they exist on the same plane and perspective as the rest. In this case the pool chamber on the upper left feels like it is lifted up and out of the plane of the rest of the structure.



Eintrance 
[[heart-of-darkling-1b-patreon.jpg]]
	One of the first structures people encounter when travelling along the Heart of Darkling is the “Demon Bridge” where the bitter ice demon and his kobold allies have complete control and use their domain to trade ice-iron weapons and hardware to those who know of their existence.
	Below the Demon Bridge is the home of these creatures and their master – a small set of dungeons and caves where they ply their craft and live.
	The main hall of the Demon Halls is a 30′ tall arched cavern that has been crudely cut to have pillars down the middle and matching supports on both walls set at 20 foot intervals. Kobolds regularly run through here, but never tarry, for the cave is older than their clan and they believe that their liege was born or spontaneously created within this hall and that he haunts this space. (He actually lives in the secret pillared chamber on the level above and is only down here when his magics are needed in the craft of the ice-iron weapons). The halls below the main hall are where most of the work is done. These rooms are the smithies of the kobolds, with ice-cold water coming in from a small cut in the wall linking to the river above which is in turn used in multiple capacities through the smithing chambers. What is not found here are mines, as the ice-iron does not actually use any natural source of iron and instead uses discarded portions of the bitter ice demon himself as the primary ingredient. To the north are living chambers and guard posts, and a guarded staircase that leads to a secret exit on the surface (used by the kobolds to hunt surface creatures for food and by particularly brave kobolds who wish to see the daystar).




[[heart-of-darkling-1a-patreon.jpg]]
	There is a river that dips underground through a low-ceilinged cave before descending fairly gently under the grey hills to depths unknown. However, all it takes is a magic spell to lower the water level at the cave entrance to make this easily navigable by boat, as the river cave has a fairly high ceiling after the entrance… and at least one local merchant has been acquiring goods from someone along the underground river in this manner.
	The very first structures along the river are attached to a small tower on the hills above and were once used by bandits but have been abandoned in recent years. The connection between the bandit dungeons and the demon’s bridge further down has been locked, barred, and sealed by the residents of the southern portion.
	A few hundred feet from the river entrance is a stone bridge that spans the water with a good 12 feet of clearance between the bottom of the span and the river itself. This is “the Demon’s Bridge” and is generally occupied by a few kobold scouts working for the bitter cold demon that is their lord. This is where trades are generally made for ice-iron weapons and arrowheads – the kobolds and their liege will not harass (except verbally) those who pass below along or against the river’s flow. From the demon’s bridge there is a long hall that eventually leads to hand-smoothed natural steps leading down to further kobold lairs.
	On the right side of the river (the left side of the map, as the river flows from the top of the page to the bottom) are a number of smaller dungeons, crypts and other constructions, some linked to the demon’s bridge, others fully independent. The crypts were used by an order of druids who only preserved their highest of archdruids here, awaiting the day that the natural cycle is broken and they all awaken as one to set things right again. The other structures have seen a variety of uses by merchants, bandits, kobolds and others over the years.


[[heart-of-darkling-waystation-patreon.jpg]]
	This stop along the Heart of Darkling is a small “village” put together by a team of mercenaries and bandits (more of the latter than the former). They deal with the kobolds upriver of them and are paid by the surface merchant who also deals with the kobolds and their master to interdict traffic from the surface further down the river. They only half-heartedly do this job, and spend most of their time fishing for blind cave fish, travelling back and forth from the surface by boat, and occasionally heading deeper downriver in order to trade or seek employment from the mudfolk and darker creatures in the depths.
	The cave where the “village” is built is a fairly tall limestone cave – the houses were built to make the place feel less alien and hostile to the humans who dwell here. There are usually 1d3 boats tied up here. Northeast of the village is a water-filled cave with an exit to the east. This can lead to any number of other dungeons, dungeon levels, or other maps such as last month’s [Infested Hall](https://rpgcharacters.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/infested-hall-with-video/). If the attached map has a route to the surface, then the mercenaries might have another escape path or means of acquiring reinforcements – however the assumption is that whatever is that way is hostile, thus they keep the door between the village and the flooded cave barred and locked at all times.

[[heart-of-darkling-swiftwater-monastery-patreon.jpg]]
	Swiftwater Monastery is cut into the caves where a smaller and faster tributary of the Darkling River joins it.  The monastery has a number of cells for monks in the central section, the main entry in the left section, and library, master’s chambers, and meditation room in the lower right. Each section is built around a “courtyard” with a high ceiling for training, practice and meditations. The sections are connected by bridges which pass above the two rivers – ten feet above for the one on the left over the Darkling itself, and about three feet above the Swiftwater on the right.

[[the-weeping-outpost-patreon.png]]
	Those travelling along the underground passage of the Darkling River tend to avoid this small fortress. While several of the stops so far have included methods of getting to the surface, this fortress instead links up to the underdark proper.
	The drow who guard this fortress call it “The Weeping Outpost” and while assignments here are important (as it guards a “back entrance” into the heart of their deeper territories), most dark elves have no love for the damp and cold place – too close to the surface to be comfortable and too far from the strange comforts they enjoy in the depths. They bide their time and hope to get relieved and travel home as quickly as possible.
