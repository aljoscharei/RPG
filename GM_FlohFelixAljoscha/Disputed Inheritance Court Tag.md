They’re well-balanced enough that brute force seems a risky route to take, though matters are rapidly coming to a head as the need to establish a new leader is intense.

5.  E  Cruel and vicious heir, Incompetent heir who has the best claim, Outside enemy backing the strife
    
6.  F  Most talented heir but with the worst position, Hapless heir in dire need of protection, Loyal retainer trying to avert disaster
    

C Legitimacy rests on possession of a now-lost relic, If the struggle lasts much longer the patrimony will be ruined or lost, A selfish regent is exploiting the court during the interregnum

T Bribe intended for the faction leaders, Precious relic of legitimacy, The real and verified will

P Tense and angry court meeting hall, Heir’s country estate, Court plaza where the factions don’t mingle
