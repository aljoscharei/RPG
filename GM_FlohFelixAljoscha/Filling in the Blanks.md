###  Hex Generation
The rules in this document present guidelines for generating random hex content for use in fantasy role-playing games. It uses the Old School Essentials system by Necrotic Gnome as well as the Third Kingdom Games Populated Hexcrawl series and other supplements. However, it can be easily adapted for use by any fantasy system, OSR or not. This document references other publications by Third Kingdom Games:
- Domain Building. A free supplement geared towards higher-level domain play.
- Hexcrawl Basics. A free supplement that offers a mechanical process for running hexcrawl-style games.
- Random Weather Generation. A supplement that provides a method of randomly generating weather and unusual events. [[202104290619 Todd Into the Wild#Random Weather Generation]]
The system used here assumes that each hex is 6 miles from face to face and is divided into a number of subhexes, each one 1.2 miles face to face. _The area of the 6 mile hex. is: 31.82643359m2_

.**Each 6-mile hex has 1d6 features and 1d6 lairs**.

As an alternate rule, the Referee can roll 1d4 for both features and lairs when populating desert or grassland hexes, and 1d8 for both when populating jungle and mountainous hexes. Ex. Rolling 1d6 twice yields a 3 and a 5. There are 3 lairs and 5 features in the sample hex.
It is trivially easy to adjust the hex spacing: 5- and 8-mile hexes are two other popular hex sizes. If using sizes smaller or larger than this range, however, it is recommended that you adjust the number of lairs and features accordingly. Smaller hexes should have 1d4 lairs and features, while larger hexes should have 1d8 lairs and features. It is also possible to use this supplement to populate maps that are much less dense, or to generate features on the fly as needed.

Likewise, it is possible that the Referee does not want this level of granularity in their game, and chooses to use this supplement to place one feature or lair per hex, rather than placing multiple features and lairs within a hex. If this is the case, it is recommended that the Referee use Table 1.2 [[Filling in the Blanks#^LairandFeature]], below, instead of [[Filling in the Blanks#^FeatureNoLairs]]. Additionally, don’t roll 1d6 to determine the number of lairs and features per hex; instead, roll 1d20 once, or potentially twice, per hex, depending on how many points of interest are desired.

This supplement assumes that a hex map is generated and filled in with the appropriate terrain before hexes are populated. It does not provide guidance for the creation of an initial hex map. for that, see [[202203191340 Welsh Piper MOC]]

#### Placing Lairs and Features

Once it has been determined how many lairs and features are present in a hex you can determine where they are placed. This initial placement is not set in stone and can be adjusted during the process as the overall content of the hex becomes apparent. For each point of interest use a random number generator to generate a number between 1 and 31, and refer to Figure One. ![[Subhex.png]]. `dice: 1d31`.
An online random number generator or dice roller is recommended for several of the mechanics described in this book, whether to generate a range of numbers for which there are not corresponding dice or to generate large numbers (such as rolling 10d100).
Reroll any duplicates in the same category, but not those in separate categories.
This book presents lair generation prior to feature generation. However, it is recommended that features be generated first, as it is possible the terrain in a hex will change upon feature generation, and a generated lair may not fit in the new terrain. Conversely, you may find creative explanations for a lair that exists in a non- traditional terrain.
The same applies to generating features. If a feature is not appropriate for the given terrain either roll again or find a creative solution for its placement. Why, for instance, would a large body of water be in the middle of a sun-baked desert? If the Referee does not want to deal with this it is simple enough to reroll, otherwise a creative explanation can be incorporated, utilizing a strange feature to bedevil the players.
Features are typically rolled for and placed first, since they may have an impact on the location of lairs or the encounter table that is used (if the terrain changes as a result of the feature, for instance).
Roll 1d20 for each feature present, ignoring or rerolling results that don’t make any sense, and compare to the table  [[Filling in the Blanks#^FeatureNoLairs]].
Note that some feature types can appear across multiple categories. For instance, it is possible to find changed terrain in the Geologic, Terrain, and Magic sections.
As a general rule of thumb the tables provided herein are to be used as a guide. Occasionally a random roll will produce a result that is seemingly out of place; these results present the Referee with two options: Option One is to ignore the result and reroll, which is a perfectly valid option. Option Two, however, is to ask oneself “why” the result is as it is. Oftentimes an unexpected or incongruous result can lead to interesting encounters.
In some cases a feature is hidden and not immediately obvious to a casual inspection. This is the case for a cave system that has no entrances above ground, or a deposit of iron ore buried deep beneath the surface. In such instances, rather than deprive the adventurers of a potentially interesting/dangerous/lucrative feature, it is recommended that such features become apparent after a thorough survey of the hex by an expert prospector (see below).

##### Value of Features

PCs are going to PC, as the saying goes, and you can assume that any potentially usable features that are discovered will potentially be used by the adventurers. This should be allowed — nay, encouraged — with the caveat that the process of utilizing a structure will become an adventure in and of itself. Crumbling keeps left abandoned should certainly be claimed by the PCs, and fixed up, and used as a base for future operations. However, such tasks should not be accomplished without significant effort on the part of the PCs. The surrounding territory will need to be cleared of all threats in order to attract workers (see p. 11 of Domain Building) to repair the keep, materials will need to be obtained and transported, etc. At some point the Referee will likely want to determine both the potential value of the structure and the cost to repair it. The OSE core rulebook provides some guidelines for pricing strongholds starting on p. 136. These can be used to extrapolate general base values: a civilian building made of stone has a base cost of 25 gp per linear foot of wall, for instance, so an abandoned manor house with a total perimeter of 600 linear feet would have a value of 15,000 gp. The work that needs to be done in order to make a structure habitable or usable can be estimated from its age and condition.

Sometimes structures can be used even in poor condition. A ruined keep that is half collapsed can still provide temporary shelter for troops, but would use its current gp value to determine the amount of land it can garrison. A castle with a base value of 100,000 gp could, in theory, garrison six hexes, but if it has been damaged to the point of needing 50,000 gp of work it could only garrison three hexes until repaired.
Structures made of exotic or magical components have an increased value, although this only counts towards the cost of repairs or potentially sale. A keep made of magically-shaped diamond might be worth five times what a stone keep of the same size is worth, but it can only be used to garrison the same area of land; the value of the diamond does not count towards the garrison size.
In their exploration the adventurers will also likely discover resources that can be claimed and used. There are several ways to handle this: as discussed in the book Domain Building, these resources can potentially be used to increase the productive value of the hex, or the resources can be utilized immediately to create wealth for the adventurers.
It is up to the Referee to determine the in-game effects of various resources; a vein of rare granite could be used, perhaps, to build a stronghold more resistant to damage, or it could be of sufficiently high quality to be used as base material for the creation of magical items. If the Referee uses some system of alchemy, mineral or herbal resources can be used to aid in the creation of alchemical or herbal concoctions.
Once a hex has been cleared of all threats and safely patrolled, the party can bring in hirelings to conduct a more thorough survey in order to uncover any hidden, as yet undiscovered features. Surveying requires a trained hireling and uses the following guidelines:



- Surveyors cost 250 gp per month.
- It takes 1d8 days plus additional days dependent upon the type of terrain to conduct an entire survey of a 6-mile hex
	- Plains, farmland, savannah, etc. 18 days.  
	- Woods (light), hills (barren, grass). 24 days. 
	- Wooded hills, mountains. 30 days.
	- Jungle, swamp, wooded mountain, desert, arctic, etc. 40 days.
- The survey detects all subterranean features that are within 50’ of the surface as well as hidden or undiscovered features/lairs.
- It increases the land revenue of the hex by 10% due to increased efficiency.

#### Age of Features
In many fantasy settings civilizations have risen and fallen multiple times, leaving behind ruined cities, forbidden dungeons, and once-marvelous magic or technology. Many of the features that can be discovered while exploring may be relics from bygone eras.

It may be helpful to establish a rough timeline of previous civilizations before beginning to populate your setting, as well as establishing certain key aspects of these bygone features. Perhaps the previous civilization specialized in building using carefully fitted and shaped stones, laid so tightly and precisely that no mortar was needed. Roads and buildings dating back to this era might all be built in a similar fashion.

Some cultures may have built structures using forgotten techniques, whether magical or mundane, that have withstood the grind of the centuries and function just as well now as they did then, while other more decadent or corrupt civilizations may have built with lesser materials, or more hastily, and their leavings are crumbling mere decades after societal collapse.

Perhaps current settlements are built utilizing the structures of previous civilizations; a bridge, built by the ancients, still functions, and so is used as a primary means of passage, or two cities have arisen at opposite ends of an ancient road, flat and smooth and wide enough for six wagons to pass side by side, yet built thousands of years ago by unknown hands.

Some features, chiefly those that are not natural, have entries that refer to “their original use”. This means that the feature is used for the original purpose intended by the builder or the builder’s descendants. Therefore, a wizard’s tower that currently houses a gang of goblins would not be used for its original purposes, nor would a keep that is now inhabited by brigands.

#### Frequency of Features

This document seeks to provide a means of randomly populating hexmaps in a relatively efficient manner. In doing so, assumptions are made that those features generated are simply the most interesting ones discovered in a hex. It does not seek to plot all of the streams, creeks, and brooks that can be found in 32 square miles, nor every tree, nor every road. Use your judgment when placing features and describing the map to your players.

#### Determine Directions

Sometimes the Referee will need to determine which direction a feature faces or is oriented. The simplest way to do this is to roll 1d6 and compare it to Figure Two.

Another option would be to roll 1d8 and assign 1 to north, 2 to northeast, 3 to east, etc. Directional generation can be used once to determine the general direction in which a feature is running, or, for large features spanning more than one subhex, multiple times (every subhex, every other one, etc.) to create a more random and chaotic feature. ![[Hex Direction.png]]


### Lairs

For each lair that is present within the hex roll 1d8 and compare the result to the Wilderness Encounter table on p. 206 of the OSE rules. This determines which encounter sub-table to use.
Ex. The results of 1d8 are 4, 5, and 3, which correspond to subtables 1 – Flyer, F – Human, and 1 – Dragon.
Depending on your campaign and the hex being populated you may wish to reroll one or more results.
For instance, I typically reroll an initial result of “Dragon”, as such creatures are rare in the Absalom setting. I also reroll an initial result of Human when populating hexes in wilderness terrain, as human habitations are few and far between. Rerolling the initial result means that you reroll the first time it comes up, but not if it comes up again.
Once the subtables are determined you can generate the type of lair encountered. Each subtable has results between 1-12, with each being a monster from the rulebook. Instead of rolling 1d12, however, I use a random number generator to produce a result from 1-16. A result of 1-12 is referenced from the entry in the book; a result of 13-15 means I draw a monster from another source, and a result of 16 indicates a unique monster created for the lair.
The results are 3 (for Flyer), 9 (for Human), and 14 (for Dragon). Referring to the tables we get the following results:
- Flyer is Griffon 
- Human is High-level cleric  
- Dragon is drawn from another source.
Referring to the initial placement rolls above, the griffon lair is in subhex 0304, the cleric lair in subhex 0703, and the dragon in 0403.
###### Placing Lairs
As mentioned at the beginning of this book, monster lairs are placed using the Wilderness Encounter tables (starting on p. 206 of OSE core). As with features, lair locations can be chosen, rather than placed randomly; if a subhex has a ruined structure, it will likely make sense for a monster to lair in it, if possible. Once the type of creatures are determined refer to the appropriate monster listing and roll to determine the number of monsters encountered using the die roll in the parenthesis. 

There is a 1-2 in 6 chance that the number of monsters in the lair are actually that number multiplied by (1-4) 2, (5-7) 4, (8-10) 5, (11-12) 6. Ex. 

| dice 1d6 |                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-2      | There are more creatures in the lair than expected. multiply the determined number by `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^morelairmonsters]]` |
| 3-6      |                                                                                                        |

| 8-10       | 5 * |
| 11-12      | 6 * |
^morelairmonsters

The entry for goblin states that 6d10 goblins are encountered in the wilderness. There’s a 1-2 in 6 chance that a goblin lair actually numbers 12d10, 24d10, 30d10, or 36d10. Otherwise, placement of lairs is similar to populating a dungeon, except in a much larger, open area.

Magical features are broken into several categories, but they all share several broad traits: Unless otherwise stated magical features cannot be dispelled by anything short of a wish or divine intervention. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a magical feature always occur. A zone where spells have their range increased by 25% *always* increases their range by 25%. The magic affects `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^magicarea]]`There’s `dice: 1d6 <=2` chance that, when subjects of a magical effect leave the affected area, the effect ends. This applies to effects such as curses, but also more permanent effects, like the sentience of animals, which may find themselves reverting to their normal intelligence should they leave the magical area. |

Perhaps the underground river that formed the cavern system has cut its way down from the upper levels and can only be found further beneath the earth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6         | Formed not by water. It is also possible that a cave system has been created by other means: burrowing monsters such as purple worms, or extinct lava tubes, or the intrusion of elemental planes into the material are all possible sources for the creation of unique cave systems. Use the Dungeon Stocking Table on p. 225 of OSE core to determine what is present in a cave system. As a rule of thumb, caves of 1-4 chambers will generally be inhabited by only a single type of monster (whether goblins, mountain lions, etc.). Larger caves will be populated as dungeons, with multiple and diverse populations. [[Filling in the Blanks#Dungeons]] |

This section covers all sorts of structures that can be found in the wilderness, from simple lean-to shelters to elaborate mansions and free-holds, from abandoned shepherd huts to ruined castles and keeps.


Unless otherwise stated, structures  in Civilized are `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^structureabandoned]]`those in Borderlands have a 1-3 in 6 chance, and those in Wilderness areas have a 1-2 in 6 chance. For a discussion of the differences between Civilized, Borderlands, and Wilderness hexes refer to p. 15 of the supplement Domain Building. [[202104290619 Todd Into the Wild]].  The Structures are `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^StructuresMaster]]`.

#### Monuments
The civilizations of the past leave behind great works whose function is to memorialize great heroes and rulers, portentous events and defining battles, while current rulers do the same to make their glory known to their subjects. Monuments can also be alien or inscrutable in nature, of uncertain purpose or provenance, or even simple structures erected by the common folk to commemorate certain events.

Monuments fall into several different categories. . .

Perhaps the memorial is a permanent illusion that constantly replays the final moments of a decisive battle, or a field of magical energy that causes those within it to experience a specific emotion. Memorials could also be abstract works of art like the chalk figures of England, or the Nazca lines of Peru. |

^dwellingMaterials

The materials used in the construction of a dwelling will be largely dependent upon the size and resident. For instance, most buildings in a forested hex might be log cabins with thatched roofs, inhabited by independent freeholders, while a retired adventurer might live in a wood-framed house with a cedar shake roof, and a noble’s manor may be stone with a slate roof. Most dwellings on a prairie may be sod, with larger/wealthier houses being wood, or perhaps brick or adobe.

^fortificationType


Just as there are dwellings scattered throughout the wilds there are also countless structures erected primarily for strategic purposes. These structures differ from dwellings in that their primary purpose is to provide a fortified position for the builders, as opposed to living quarters. When possible such structures will be located in areas that provide a wide field of vision of the surroundings.

The age of the fortification will be . . .

[[Filling in the Blanks#^monumentAge]]

It will be in the following condition. Subtract 1 from the roll for every 100 years in age, with a maximum modifier of –15:

[[Filling in the Blanks#^dwellingCondition]]

The fortifications will be built out of the following . . .

##### Walls
This section covers boundary walls as opposed to walls that would encircle a keep or settlement. A boundary wall demarcates the border between two territories, perhaps that no longer even exist, or was erected to serve as a defensive bulwark during a battle or conflict, then left to remain standing.

Assume that a wall begins in the subhex in which it is rolled for, running north (1), northeast (2), east (3), southeast (4), south (5), southwest (6), west (7), or northwest (8). 

It will be

##### Hillforts
Using the very contours of the land as a defensive feature hillforts tend to be somewhat primitive in nature. Typically, a hill is contoured, with dirt removed to level sections being used to created earthen walls behind which defenders may shelter. Wood and stone can be incorporated into the fort as well, but most times the primary material used is packed dirt.

Most of the time hillforts will be used purely as defensive structures, but over time these will often begin to attract houses and settlements to the relatively safety of the fortifications. If they remain, these hillforts will occasionally be built into larger communities, defended by more sophisticated walls and keeps.

##### Berm

Dirt has been dug and piled into a raised fortification, typically as a short-term protective measure. The trench created by the excavation is typically on the outside of the berm, facing the threat, and can be filled with water, or sharpened stakes, or magically summoned oozes, etc.

It will be . .

For a berm that is fewer than ten years old there’s a 1-3 in 6 chance that it is currently being used; those older have only a 1 in 6 chance of being in use. As a general rule, older berms have a tendency to be converted over time to actual walls and more defensive permanent structures.

Berms that are older than two years, and either not in use or not being well-maintained, will likely be discovered in the process of being taken back over by nature; plants will have begun to reclaim the earthen slopes, trenches get filled in by leaves and decaying  vegetable matter, water, and so forth. For trenches that are currently being used for defensive purposes refer to the next section, below.

Berms are typically as wide at the base as they are tall, sloped more severely on the outside, with a gentler slope on the inside to allow defenders easier access to the top. Berms that are currently being used have a 1 in 6 chance per 8 feet in height of having

##### Trenches
The opposite of berms, trenches are dug into the ground to provide protection to forces or an obstacle to advancing enemies. Use the tables above to determine length and depth. Use the chances given above for gates or openings to determine whether a trench has some means of crossing, such as a bridge. Trenches by themselves have a

If the trenches are more than a year old or abandoned there’s a 1-3 in 6 chance any hazards have been rendered useless by age and the elements. Abandoned trenches also have a 1-2 in 6 chance of being filled with water.

^TowerMaterial

Towers are typically used as fortified residences or smaller garrisons to secure small areas. However, towers are quick and easy to build and are often implemented as a first “wave” of civilization designed to provide a quick and dirty fortified garrison. Towers have a base value of `dice: 1d12 * 5000` gp.

Keeps are larger, designed to control larger territories, and provide housing and shelter for the settlers. Keeps have a base value of `dice: 3d6 * 10000` gp.

Castles are larger still, the last stage in the evolution of defensive structures. Towers are built to quickly pacify the wilderness, and as civilization spreads they get expanded into keeps, which in turn are added onto and become sprawling castles. Castles have a base value of `dice: 2d6 * 100000` gp, and often house hundreds of residents.

The chance that a structure is uninhabited decreases based upon its size; towers are the most likely to be found uninhabited and castles the least likely. The beginning of this section gives chances that a structure is used for its intended purpose; add 1 to the roll for castles and subtract 1 for towers.

Ex. Structures in Borderlands hexes have a 1-3 in 6 chance of being used for their intended purpose. Towers, therefore, have a 1-2 in 6 chance, keeps a 1-3, and castles a 1-4 chance.

In Borderland hexes the road has  `dice: 1d6<5` chance of being used regularly for commerce and travel. This chance is increased by one in Civilized hexes and decreased by 1 in Wilderness hexes, or domains with an alignment of Chaotic. Roads that are not used regularly have fallen into disrepair and do not grant the 50% bonus to overland movement (see p. 111, OSE core).
If a road connects two settlements, add the highest Market Class to the following roll for the size of the road. Refer to p. 16 of Domain Building for information on Market Classes.

When rolling to determine the length of the road you will roll either once (if the road terminates in the chosen hex) or twice (if the road passes through the hex). If rolling once take the result and double it. If rolling twice add the two numbers together to get the total length of the road. When rolling twice designate which roll is for which length of road exiting the hex.

^WaterstructureAge


There’s a 1-3 in 6 chance that a water feature is currently in use. This chance decreases by 1 in Wilderness hexes and/or if the feature is over 500 years old and increases by 1 if in Civilized hexes and/or it is less than one hundred years old (for a total range of modifiers of –2 to +2).

A feature that is not currently in use will typically have fallen into disrepair or could potentially serve as a lair for dangerous creatures that prevent its use.

###### Fountain

A fountain serves both decorative and functional purposes. In both cases, they are most often created using naturally occurring underground springs where there is enough water pressure to bring the water above ground level.

Fountains are artificially created by using impermeable substances to fashion bowl-shaped depressions, which are often surrounded by a low border and can also include statuary mounted inside from which the water emerges.

The fountain will be made from . . .

| 76-85  | Ranch In all other respects similar to farms, [[#Farm.]] but ranches primarily raise livestock.

Add 10 to the roll when determining the ranch size. If the result is 101 or above the ranch is 1d4 subhexes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 86-95  | Shrine. Unlike temples, that are staffed by priests of a deity, shrines are smaller structures dedicated to a deity. There are typically no full-time attendants of a shrine, although there may be a part-time caretaker that occasionally visits the shrine to look after the place. The shrine will be dedicated to a `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^MonasteryAlignment]]` Diety. There’s `dice: 1d6>=3` chance there’s a semi-permanent caretaker that visits every  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ShrineAttendant]]`. It will be `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ShrineSize]]` There’s `dice: 1d6>=3` chance the shrine possesses divine properties that will take effect `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ShrineTrigger]]`, These effects usually take the form of a bane or a boon; banes occur when, for instance, a Chaotic creature enters the grounds of a Lawful shrine.

| 96-100 | Temple. Temples are larger than shrines, with a permanent contingent of worshipers. Temples have the same proportions of alignments as shrines. Like monasteries, temples should be treated as name-level strongholds run by clerics or paladins. Use the rules in the OSE rulebooks to determine the number of followers. There will be support staff in the temple equal to `dice: 3d4*10`% of the followers. The support staff may be generally followers of the deity, but are considered to be 0-level NPCs. `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^TempleArchitecture]]`. Every temple contains a shrine that has `dice: 1d6>=2` chance of having divine properties similar to other shrines, above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

^FarmSize


If the farm is found in a forested, swamp, jungle, or mountain hex subtract 10 from the roll.

All farms, in addition to growing crops, will keep a variety of animals. Chickens for eggs, pigs to forage and eat scraps, horses, mules, or oxen to work the fields, etc. The primary focus of the farmer is on growing crops, though. Most farms grow a variety of plants, instead of one single crop, and they will typically be working from early spring through late fall planting, harvesting, and preparing food for storage. 

Surplus crops are

| 5-6       | tithed to the domain ruler (if in an existing domain). |
^Surplus

The smallest farms consist of a single family living in one or two buildings. The larger a farm gets the more hands are needed to run it, and the more infrastructure is needed to support the operation. Large farms will typically consist of 1d2 buildings for every ten acres under cultivation. These buildings include: houses for the farmers (typically a main house for the owners, plus smaller outbuildings that the workers live in), smithies/workshops to repair equipment, barns to house livestock, smokehouses to cure meat, root cellars to preserve harvested food, granaries or silos to store grain, etc.

Large farms, especially those encountered in Wilderness hexes, function as small settlements, are often protected by walls, and often serve as waystations or inns for travelers to rest in, whether they sleep in a barn or there is a dedicated building for use by travelers.

Farms that are larger than 50 acres may be large enough to have supplies available for sale. Such farms have a 


Farms that are over 100 acres will be a market of Class `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^Farmmarketclass]]`.

Depending on the weather or season a ferry may not be operable. Heavy rains or melting snow cover may render the river too dangerous to cross, and obviously a frozen river does not need a ferry, provided the ice is thick enough to walk across.

###### Ford. 
Simply a shallow part of a river or large stream, fords allow for travelers to cross in relative safety, albeit while getting wet. 

There’s `dice: 1d6<3` chance that the crossing is dangerous during certain times of the year, or after heavy rain. In these cases those crossing must succeed on a Save v. Death to avoid being swept off their feet. If the travelers are mounted while crossing their mounts make the save, but with a +2 bonus to the roll.

If a ford is frequently used there’s `dice: 1d20<2` chance it is watched by brigands or monsters who use the distraction of crossing to attack. This chance is reduced to 1 in 100 in Civilized hexes.

Fords are

Because they are shallower they are also wider, which may be important to know if travelers are trying to cross swiftly. Assume that a ford is roughly twice as wide as other parts of the river.

Fords that are deeper than five feet are typically only crossed by mounted travelers, and are used simply because the wider, shallower part of the river is slower moving than other areas.

###### Hunting Lodge. 
Hunting lodges are maintained for three distinct reasons:

| 4-5       | maintained by nobles that maintain the house for use during sport hunting, or                            |
| 6         | maintained by name-level ranger-type characters that use it as a base of operations in Wilderness hexes. |
^LodgeOwner

Hunting lodges consist of `dice: 1d4` buildings, typically of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^LodgeMaterial]]`

Because they are often forced to rely on their own supplies for long periods of time there’s `dice: 1d6<3` chance that a hunting lodge has a Market Class of 1.

###### Inn
Found mostly along heavily trafficked trade routes where there is not enough population to support a community, but enough travel to support a business, roadside inns in Borderland or Wilderness hexes are most often fortified complexes with walls that enclose the main inn and outbuildings. Roadside inns have 1d8 features in Borderland hexes and 2d6 in Wilderness hexes (roll 1d00 to determine the features), listed below. Unless otherwise indicated results are cumulative.

Large domains often maintain barracks or garrisons on their borders to project their power into Borderlands or Wilderness areas outside of the domain proper. These are to be treated as keeps, housing a military garrison of the appropriate size based upon the size of the keep. [[#Tower/Keep/Castle]]

Garrisons will also contain a surplus of supplies for the forces to use should they be under attack or need to march to war. Each garrison will have a supply of dried rations, weapons, and ammunition that can be drawn from to supply troops.

Water-powered lumber mills use blades driven by running water, while manually powered mills utilize teams of workers using pitsaws, or even splitting logs down into lumber. A typical lumber mill has `dice: 2d20` employees, plus draft horses to help move materials around. The workers will typically live adjacent to the mill, and there will be `dice: 1d2` support staff on hand for every five workers. This support staff includes laborers (`dice: 1d6>=5` chance per 5 workers), blacksmiths (`dice: 1d6>=3` chance per 5 workers), animal handlers (`dice: 1d6>=2` chance per 5 workers), etc.

| 1-3       | dug mines. Dug mines are created by digging shafts into the ground that follow veins of minerals. They can descend deep into the earth, and require physical bracing and reinforcement. The deeper a dug mine goes the more labor is needed to efficiently extract materials, and the more dangerous it becomes. dug mines have `dice: 1d100` workers |
| 4-5       | sluice. Sluice mines rely on exposing surface minerals with running water, either by blasting surface dirt with pressurized water or by panning to separate heavier minerals. Sluice mines have `dice: 1d8` workers                                                                                                                                   |
| 6         | strip mines. Strip mines also require digging, but instead of digging narrow tunnels that follow the path of mineral veins they rely on removing large amounts of earth to exposed seams of valuable minerals. strip mines `dice: 5d100`workers                                                                                                       |
^MineType

A mine will be 

| dice:1d6 |                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3      | a solo operation, run by a single individual or family, |
| 4-5      | a larger operation owned as a mercantile venture, or    |
| 6        | owned by a nearby ruler, noble, or landowner.           |
^MineOperator






Sluice mines have `dice: 1d8` workers, dug mines have `dice: 1d100` workers, and strip mines `dice: 5d100`workers. Temporary settlements spring up around the mine, with workers living in tents or semi- permanent shelters. Mining camps attract support staff. Mines that are run by consortia or domains will have `dice: 1d6–1` guards for every ten miners. There will also be blacksmiths (1-3 in 6 chance per ten miners), animal handlers (`dice: 1d6>=2` chance per 25 miners), cooks (`dice: 1d6>=3` chance per ten miners), a rudimentary tavern (`dice: 1d6>=4` chance per fifty miners), etc.

Mines will be visited every `dice: 1d4` weeks by supply caravans that bring supplies to the miners then return to settlements with ore. There’s `dice: 1d6>=2` chance per fifty workers that a mining camp has a smelter to process ore before shipping it away.

Refer to the section on Resources on p. 37 for more information.

###### Monastery. 
Many monastic orders are headquartered in remote areas. They 

| dice: 1d6 |                                                      |     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| 1-3       | are primarily religious,                             |     |
| 4-5       | are primarily martial, or                                |     |
| 6         | are primarily esoteric (specializing in magical research | .   |
^MonasteryType

They will be 

| dice:1d6 |             |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 1-2      | Lawful,     |
| 3-4      | Neutral, or |
| 5-6      | Chaotic.    |
^MonasteryAlignment

Monasteries should be treated as the domains of name-level characters: strongholds founded by clerics (from the core rules) or assassins (p. 8, Advanced Fantasy). Use the rules in those books to determine the number of leveled characters present, and assume they have support staff equal to mining camps. Monasteries are also constructed as keeps and strongholds, usually 


| dice:1d6 |                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-4      | of stone or brick, but occasionally |
| 5-6      | of wood or other materials.         |
^MonasteryMaterial

Otherwise, monasteries are built along the lines of dungeons.

###### Orchard.
Similar to farms, [[#Farm.]] but instead of planting seasonal crops the farmers tend orchards of 

| dice:1d6 |               |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 1-3      | fruit trees,  |
| 4-5      | nut trees, or |
| 6        | grape vines.  |
^orchardType

Because of the higher density and perennial nature of their crop subtract 10 from the roll when determining the size of the orchard. Orchards have  `dice: 1d6>=4` chance of being surrounded by a low wall, and `dice: 1d6>=2` chance of being patrolled by 1d4 guards for every ten acres. These guards are the equivalent of 


| dice:1d6 |               |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 1-4      | light foot or |
| 5-6      | heavy foot.   |
^OrcharGuards

###### Other.
Use this category for features that are not included in any of the others.

###### Quarry.
Quarries are similar to mines, except they are usually 

| dice: 1d6 |                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1-5       | of the strip mine variety, and only very rarely |
| 6         | dug mines.                                      |
^QuarryType

Refer to the section on Resources, below.

###### Ranch.
In all other respects similar to farms, [[#Farm.]] but ranches primarily raise livestock. Ranches have `dice: 1d6>=2` chance of being surrounded by wooden fences with a primary purpose of keeping animals in rather than protecting the property from external threats. Add 10 to the roll when determining the ranch size. If the result is 101 or above the ranch is 1d4 subhexes.


###### Shrine. 
Unlike temples, that are staffed by priests of a deity, shrines are smaller structures dedicated to a deity. There are typically no full-time attendants of a shrine, although there may be a part-time caretaker that occasionally visits the shrine to look after the place. The shrine will be dedicated to a [[Filling in the Blanks#^MonasteryAlignment]] Diety.


There’s `dice: 1d6>=3` chance there’s a semi-permanent caretaker that visits every 


| dice:1d6 |                      |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| 1- 3     | `dice: 1d4` weeks,   |
| 4-5      | `dice: 1d8` days, or |
| 6        | `dice: 1d4` months.  |
^ShrineAttendant

The shrine will be 


| dice:1d6 |                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1-3      | a statue, object, or natural feature, |
| 4-5      | a single room or rudimentary shelter, |
| 6        | a building with `dice: 1d4+1` rooms.  |
^ShrineSize


There’s `dice: 1d6>=3` chance the shrine possesses divine properties that will take effect 


| dice:1d6 |                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | whenever someone of a certain alignment enters,     |
| 2        | whenever something is left or taken,                |
| 3        | upon everyone who enters,                           |
| 4        | if a specific action is taken within the shrine, or |
| 5-6      | other.                                              |
^ShrineTrigger


These effects usually take the form of a bane or a boon; banes occur when, for instance, a Chaotic creature enters the grounds of a Lawful shrine. Banes will impose the following: 


| dice:1d6 |                                                                                            |                                 |     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | --- |
| 1        | the offending creature suffers a penalty of `dice: 1d4` to a specific roll,                |                                 |     |
| 2        | the offending creature automatically rolls the lowest possible result on their next roll,  |                                 |     |
| 3        | the offending creature must Save v. Spells or have their alignment change to its opposite, |                                 |     |
| 4        | the offending creature must Save v. Polymorph or be turned into another form               | stone, or ooze, or animal, etc. | ,   |
| 5        | the offending creature is targeted by the geas spell, or                                   |                                 |     |
| 6        | other.                                                                                     |                                 |     |
^ShrineBane

Banes last for 


| dice:1d6 |                       |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| 1- 3     | `dice: 1d8` days,     |
| 4-5      | `dice: 1d4` weeks, or |
| 6        | permanently.          |
^ShrineBaneDuration

They can be removed by 

| dice:1d6 |                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | a remove curse cast by a cleric of level `dice: 1d6+8` or higher,   |
| 2        | a dispel magic cast by a spellcaster of at least level`dice: 1d6+8` |
| 3        | a wish or similar magic,                                            |
| 4        | divine intervention,                                                |
| 5        | undoing whatever action triggered the bane, or                      |
| 6        | other.                                                              |
^BaneDispel



Boons impose the following: 

| dice:1d6 |                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | the subject gains a bonus of `dice: 1d4` to a specific roll,             |
| 2        | the subject automatically succeeds on their next roll,                   |
| 3        | the subject gains a bonus `dice: 1d6` hit points,                        |
| 4        | the subject has one random ability score improved by 1,                  |
| 5        | the subject gains a bonus ability congruent with the god’s portfolio, or |
| 6        | other.                                                                   |
^ShrineBoon

Note that boons and banes that specifically call out “the next roll” do not permanently grant the modifier, but will expire once that next roll is made, regardless of how long it takes to make that roll.


###### Temple.
Temples are larger than shrines, with a permanent contingent of worshipers. Temples have the same proportions of alignments as shrines. Like monasteries, temples should be treated as name-level strongholds run by clerics or paladins. Use the rules in the OSE rulebooks to determine the number of followers. There will be support staff in the temple equal to `dice: 3d4*10`% of the followers. The support staff may be generally followers of the deity, but are considered to be 0-level NPCs.

Temples can be 


| dice:1d6 |                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3      | a single large structure divided in `dice: 3d6` rooms,     |
| 4-5      | an enclosed campus containing `dice: 2d6` outbuildings, or |
| 6        | a military-style keep.                                     |
^TempleArchitecture


Every temple contains a shrine that has `dice: 1d6>=2` chance of having divine properties similar to other shrines, above.


#### Barriers
Barriers are structures and features, both natural and man-made, that somehow block or impede progress. Barriers are either 

| dice: 1d6 |                                                                         |

| 4-5       | man-made barriers include `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ManMadeBarriers]]`             |
| 6         | magical. Magical barriers include `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^MagicalBarriersType]]` |
^barriertype

The purpose of this section is to provide obstacles that slow the adventurers’ progress.

When a barrier is rolled determine what the nature of the barrier is (man-made, natural, etc.), pick a barrier that works best with the hex, and refer to the appropriate section in this book. Barriers, if the adventurers insist on continuing on their path, will slow progress by . . .

^BarrierIntensity

Barriers that slow progress by 100% create zones (see below) that cannot be explored until the barrier is overcome. Otherwise, assume the zone can be explored, but at the slower rate. Each barrier affects a “zone”, or a certain area. The smallest area a zone can affect is a single subhex. Roll below to determine the size of the zone . . .

| 1-20        | Force fields. A force field is an `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^forcefieldVisible]]` thin magical barrier that is the result of a `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ForcefieldOrigin]]` It cannot be breached by physical means, and there’s `dice: 1d6 <=4` chance it is impervious to magical effects, including those that do not create physical results (such as charm person).  There’s a further `dice: 1d6 <=1` chance that touching the force field inflicts injury upon the one touching it, as follows `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ForcefieldDMGAmount]]`, `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ForcefieldDMGType]]` damage. When rolling to determine the size of a force field [[#^BarrierZone]] , subtract 20 from the roll. On a result of less than 1, the force field occupies `dice: 1d10*1000` sq. ft. Force fields will `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ForcefieldBypass]]`. If targeted by a spell such as dispel magic treat the force field as being of a spell level equal to `dice: 1d6+4`. There’s an additional `dice: 1d6<=1` chance that a force field completely surrounds (above and below ground) an area; otherwise it simply rises to a height of `dice: 1d100` feet. |
| 21-40       | Illusory images/terrain. Illusory images or terrain should be treated as spells such as hallucinatory terrain, massmorph, or other illusion spells. Allow those passing through the illusion to roll `dice: 4d6` and compare the result to their Intelligence score. If the result is equal to or less than their score they are able to determine that there is an illusion. Illusions are the result of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^IllusionOrigin]]`. Treat the illusion as if it were a spell of level `dice: 1d8+1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Magical walls are just that: barriers created by such spells as wall of stone, wall of fire, etc., or potentially other spells such as acid fog, cloudkill, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 61-80       | Zones of repulsion. Zones of repulsion are invisible barriers that are otherwise treated as force fields, except they can be crossed. Once inside, an affected individual must make a saving throw against spells for every turn spent inside or be compelled to leave by the fastest means possible. Zones of repulsion have only a `dice: 1d6 <=1` chance of affecting *all* creatures that enter. Otherwise, roll below to determine what manner of creatures are affected: `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^RepulsionTarget]]`. There’s a further `dice: 1d6<=1` chance that a specific creature type is affected by the barrier (goblins, rather than all humanoids).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

^RepulsionTarget

There’s a further `dice: 1d6<=1` chance that a specific creature type is affected by the barrier (goblins, rather than all humanoids).

Barriers can be overcome or avoided through spells, clever thinking, or simple brute force or ignorance. Labor can be used to clear a forest of hampering underbrush or to build a bridge across a ravine, as a permanent solution. Powerful magics may be needed to permanently eliminate other barriers, both magical and mundane.

### Resources

Whether abandoned mines, stands of valuable timber, patches of herbs or vast herds of animals, resources are anything that can be sold or used by the adventurers in their travels, usually in mercantile pursuits. Note that this section includes only resources that are immediately obvious – veins of precious metals unexposed to the air, mushrooms buried deep in forbidden dungeons and so forth are not included in this section.

This section makes use of the rules for generating additional resources found in the Domain Building book (starting on p. 26), as well as the Trade Goods tables on p. 38 of that supplement. When a resource result comes up use those rules to determine what general category the resource falls into and how valuable it is.

This section provides some additional rules for determining the exact type of resource that is present. The rules from Domain Building presume that resources have the same relative value based upon category. This is obviously not true if the size of the resource is the same: gold is far more valuable (typically) than copper, if found in the same quantity. The obvious remedy is to assume that the volume of the resource is different, even though it may take the same amount of time to extract it. This is something that will have to be abstracted by the Referee.

| 7-8   | Mineral, quarried [[#Mineral Quarried]] `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^QuarriedStones]]`, There’s  `dice: 1d6 <=3` chance that a resource of this type has previously been discovered and has been partially quarried or mined when it is encountered. This chance is decreased by 1 in Wilderness hexes and increased by 1 in Civilized hexes.  This does not affect the value of the resource, but obviously makes it more apparent and immediately accessible. If the resource has previously been discovered there’s `dice: 1d6 <=3` chance it is currently being worked. This chance is increased by 1 for Civilized hexes and decreased by 1 for Wilderness hexes. If the resource has not been discovered the vein will be found `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^MineralHowDeep]]`. No further Processing necessary. |

#### Animal, livestock

Livestock are domestic animals that are raised for meat, furs, or work. These can be represented as actual existing animal stock which implies there is something *in* the hex raising and caring for them, or the potential for such resources to exist; grasslands that are ideal for cattle or sheep, for instance.

Livestock animals include . . .

#### Mineral Quarried

There’s  `dice: 1d6 <=3` chance that a resource of this type has previously been discovered and has been partially quarried or mined when it is encountered. This chance is decreased by 1 in Wilderness hexes and increased by 1 in Civilized hexes.  This does not affect the value of the resource, but obviously makes it more apparent and immediately accessible. If the resource has previously been discovered there’s `dice: 1d6 <=3` chance it is currently being worked. This chance is increased by 1 for Civilized hexes and decreased by 1 for Wilderness hexes.
If the resource has not been discovered the vein will be found `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^MineralHowDeep]]`

^MineralHowDeep

The further a resource is underground the more difficult it is to find, and the more labor it takes to expose it. Strip mining or quarrying costs 400 gp per 20,000 cubic feet of earth removed. However, the surface opening needs to be the same diameter as the depth. A 10’ depth requires a perimeter of 10’×10’ (1,000 cubic feet of excavated material). A 30’ depth requires a perimeter of 30’×30’ (27,000 cubic feet).

Mining tunnels cost 500 gp per ten feet of depth. This assumestunnels10’×10’,r einforced as needed to prevent collapses. Mining tunnels deeper than 100 feet cost 750 gp per 10’ of depth.

Following are some types of stone that can be quarried.

^QuarriedStones

Quarried minerals, once extracted, do not have to be smelted or processed to use, although some of them certainly can be (sand, for instance, can be heated and turned into glass). They do not need to be chemically refined or altered in order to be useful, however.

Minerals are not part of the Trade Good table (p. 38 of Domain Building), so they have been added here:

###### Quarried Minerals (common). 

These include common materials that are quarried for alchemical usage (such as gypsum) or for base building materials: Chalk, Clay, Gabbro, Gypsum, Sand, Slate.

###### Stone (rare). Coal, Coquina, Granite, Limestone, Marble*, Sandstone.

*marble has a base price of 1,500 gp per load.

#### Ore, mined

Valuable minerals are less likely to be visible than quarried rocks. Use the same table, above, to determine the depth at which the resource is found, adding 5 to the roll for metal and 10 for gemstones.

Mined minerals have the same chances as quarried stone to be exceptional. 

Mined ore will contain either

^Ore


Mined minerals must be smelted. Depending on the mineral and how far it must travel to its destination it can either be smelted at the mine or shipped back to civilization and then smelted.

Smelters cost 5,000 gp to build. Once complete, a smelter can process a total of 50 gp worth of ore per day. A smelter requires a minimum crew of four workers (one trained worker making 50 gp per month and three laborers making three gp a month) and costs 2 gp per day in raw materials per day of operation. Optionally, smelters designed to purify rare or magical metals may be more expensive to build and/or run than normal smelters.

The starting weight of mined ore is extrapolated from the finished weight of refined ore found on p. 38 of the Domain Building supplement. There are two types of refined ore: common and precious. Refer to the following tables to determine the weight multipliers for each material (note that these are abstracted figures meant to provide general guidelines, and do not hew directly to real-world examples).

Common Ore. Base value of 1 gp/50 cn
43-table-1.md

| Substance   | Multiplier   |
|:------------|:-------------|
| Copper      | x2           |
| Iron        | x2.5         |
| Lead        | x1.1         |
| Mica        | x1.5         |
| Natron      | x1.5         |
| Pyrite      | x1.2         |
| Silver      | x1.5         |
| Sulfur      | x2           |
| Tin         | x2.25        |
| Zinc        | x2.25        |


Ex. Copper, with a multiplier of 2, requires 100 cn of raw ore to yield 50 cn of refined material. Lead, with a multiplier of 1.1, requires 55 cn to yield the same amount

Precious Ore. Base value of 1.5 gp/1 cn
43-table-3.md

| Substance   | Multiplier   |
|:------------|:-------------|
| Antimony    | x2           |
| Arsenic     | x1.5         |
| Gold        | x1.25        |
| Mercury     | x4           |
| Nickel      | x3           |
| Oil         | x1.1*        |
| Platinum    | x1.1         |


Alchemical metals. These have a base value of 1d6 gp per cn and a multiplier of ×1d6

Special/magical metals. These have a base value of 2d6 per cn and a multiplier of ×1d8

Ex. Gold, with a multiplier of 1.25, requires 1.25 cn of raw material to yield 1 cn of pure gold.

Gems require no smelting and are most often mined in the same fashion as metal. They are found in the rough, however, and require work to cut and polish.

Wholesale gemstone prices can be found on p. 38 of Domain Building, as follows:

-  Semi-precious stones cost a base of 2 gp per cn of weight.
-   Precious stones cost a base of 60 gp per cn of weight.
    
These are abstracted numbers. They can be modified based upon the stone, if desired, with the following modifiers:

Semi-precious stones
    
- Agate, quartz, turquoise ×.5  
- Jacinth, jasper, onyx ×1  
- Amber, amethyst, coral, garnet, jade ×1.5
Ex. An agate mine yields uncut stones that are worth 1 gp per cn of weight. A jade mine yields uncut jade worth 3 gp per cn

Precious stones

- Aquamarine, pearl, topaz ×.5
- Carbuncle, opal ×.1  
- Emerald, ruby, sapphire ×1.5 
- Diamond ×2
- Magical, unique ×5

Ex. An aquamarine mine yields uncut stones worth 30 gp per cn. A diamond mine yields uncut stones worth 120 gp per cn.


#### Vegetable, agricultural

Plant resources used for food. This can be food that exists naturally in the area or crops that are currently being grown by sentient creatures. This, of course, suggests that there is someone currently growing the plants, although it is certainly possible to find abandoned agricultural operations: orchards abandoned and growing wild, or gardens left untended to go to seed, etc.

Agricultural resources are divided into two categories: cultivated and wild. Cultivated plants are tended and harvested on a regular basis; wild plants grow wild, as the name implies, without caretaking, but may certainly be harvested on a regular basis by those living nearby (both humanoids and animals).

There’s `dice 1d6<=3` chance that the resource will be wild; otherwise it will be cultivated. This chance increases by 1 in Wilderness hexes and decreases by 1 in Civilized hexes. There’s a further `dice 1d6<=1` chance that cultivated resources have been abandoned in the past `dice:1d12` years. This chance increases by 1 in Wilderness hexes.

### Hazard
Hazards range from quicksand and slippery slopes to carnivorous plants and unstable magical zones. They are either constant threats, such as a patch of quicksand, or events that are triggered once the party enters a specific subhex, such as a sinkhole that opens up under them, or a wildfire that starts burning. If it could be either constant or triggered roll 1d6. On a result of 1-2 the hazard is constant, 3-6 it is triggered when the adventurers enter the area.

| 1-20        | Concealed holes. These are smaller holes that largely pose a danger to mounts; oftentimes animal holes concealed in undergrowth. When passing through a hex with thishazard all travelers (or their mounts) must Save v. Wands. Those failing suffer twisted ankles, reducing movement by 1⁄2 for 1d4 days. There’s `dice: 1d6>=2` chance that horses or similar are lamed permanently unless magically healed. If the party is accompanied by an experienced scout, ranger, or native to the region there’s `dice: 1d6>=2` chance of avoiding this hazard altogether, and even if they don’t travelers gain a +2 bonus to saves during this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 21-40       | Falling objects. Travelers in these hexes run the risk of injury from falling objects, likely branches from overhead trees or rocks. All passing through the hex must Save v. Wands or suffer  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^HazardFallingObjects]]`. If the party is accompanied by an experienced scout, ranger, or native to the region they gain a +2 bonus to this save.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 41-60       | Quicksand. The ground is saturated here, creating areas of quicksand. There are `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^Quicksand]]` When traveling through an area with quicksand all party members must make Saves v. Death to avoid falling into the quicksand. This hazard is typically not dangerous unless all of the members fall in or people or animals begin to panic. Make a morale check for each NPC and animal that falls into the quicksand. Those that fail the morale check begin to thrash around, dying in `dice: 3d6` rounds unless help is available. Assume it takes one person per stuck individual or three people per stuck mount `dice: 2d6` rounds to rescue a sinking individual, or double the time and people needed if they are panicking. Predators can often be found stalking the perimeter of quicksand pits. When a party enters a hex with quicksand make an additional wandering monster check as follows to determine if there is a monster lurking to take advantage of trapped adventurers. See [[#^Quicksand]]                                          |
| 61-80       | Landslide. Loose soil or snow moves quickly downhill, traveling for `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^landslidelength]]`. For every 250 feet that a landslide passes over someone they must make a Save v. Death. Failure indicates they take 2d6 points of damage, or half that on a successful save. Landslides have a width of  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^landslidewidth]]`. Individuals caught in a landslide have `dice: 1d8` rounds to react before it hits them. If there is solid shelter available (a wall, perhaps) that can be used they gain a +2 bonus to their saving throws. Landslides last for `dice: 3d6` rounds. At the end of the landslide each member caught in it must make a final Save v. Death. Failure indicates they are buried a number of feet below the surface equal to the amount by which they failed the saving throw. Treat buried individuals as if they were drowning. A success indicates they manage to remain on the surface. Ex. A character is caught in a landslide and they fail their final Save by 6, meaning they are buried 6 feet under the surface. |
| 81-98       | Sinkhole. A large hole opens up underneath the adventurers, threatening to swallow them. It has a diameter of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^Sinkholediameter]]` and will be `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^sinkholedepth]]`. There’s `dice: 1d6<=4` chance it leads to a cave or dungeon complex. For every five feet in diameter, `dice: 1d2` individuals run the risk of falling into the sinkhole. Each character caught in the sinkhole must Save v. Death to avoid tumbling in. Failure indicates they take falling damage equal to the depth of the fall, with `dice: 1d6<=4` chance they take an additional `dice: 1d8` points of amage from falling earth and debris.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 99-100      | Unusual. These hazards are rare or unusual. If they occur in a location without the necessary terrain features (a volcano appearing in a location without mountains, for instance), the Referee has the option of either rerolling the result for a more appropriate one, or placing the hazard as generated and assuming it is simply an unusual location. `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^hazardunusual]]`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 1-50        | Geyser. There will be `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^geysernumber]]` with an additional `dice: 1d6 <=1` chance this feature occurs over `dice: 1d20` subhexes. Geysers are pools of extremely hot `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^geysermudwater]]`. There’s only`dice: 1d6 <=1` chance the pool will be cool enough (relatively) that individuals can enter it without suffering damage; otherwise someone not resistant to fire will suffer `dice: 1d6` points of damage for every round they’re within the pool. Geysers erupt every `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^geyserfrequency]]`. If this is generated as a hazard, assume they erupt upon the adventurers first entering the subhex, with subsequent eruptions occurring on a regular basis thereafter. Boiling water (or mud) is spread over a radius of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^geyserrange]]`. Being Hit by boiling substance causes  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^geyserdamage]]`. A geyser will erupt for `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^geyserduration]]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 91-100      | Volcano. A volcano erupts, sending ash and poisonous gas high into the air. The effects of a volcano depend on how close the adventurers are to it. A volcanic eruption will affect a radius of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^Volcanoeruptionerea]]`. The effects of a volcano include lava, gas, and ash, and are as follows: Lava affects a relatively small area surrounding the volcano, equal to a few hundred feet for small eruptions and no more than a subhex for the largest of eruptions. Creatures within the range of lava suffer 3d6 points of damage per round, taking half damage if they save against breath weapons. Lava remains a threat for `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^lavaduration]]`. Moving out of range is enough the avoid the risk of damage from lava. Gas affects an area equal to roughly 1/20th of the overall radius of the volcano’s effects, to a maximum range of four hexes from the point of eruption. Creatures within the area of effect take 1 point of suffocation damage for every minute they remain within the effect. Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to this effect. Ash is the most widespread hazard, falling within the entire range of the eruption, and divided into zones. Close range is within 1/4 of the overall radius, Medium with 1/4-3/4 of the overall radius, and Long from 3/4 to the outer limit. Ex. A volcano has a range of 4 subhexes. Those within 1 subhex of the volcano are within close range, those within 2-3 subhexes within medium range, and those in the 4th hex are at long range. At long range everyone (and everythingthing) is coated in a thin layer of ash that falls for `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^volcanuashdurationlong]]`. At medium range it falls for the same amount of time, but for `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^volcanuashdurationmedium]]` all breathing creatures suffer a –2 penalty to all 1d20 rolls. After this initial period ash continues to fall for the length of time determined above. At short range the above applies, but additionally all creatures within range suffer `dice: 1d6` points of damage from hot ash. |

#### Weather/climate

These hazards are weather-based, quick hazards that typically affect larger areas than geologic or flora/fauna- based ones. Hurricanes don’t count, for instance, since they are typically slow-moving, gradual hazards. This section will refer to the rules presented in the Random Weather Generation supplement.

| 1-12        | . Wildfire. The adventurers will have roughly `dice: 1d100` minutes of advance notice of a wildfire (double this if one or more of their party is flying). Wildfires move at a rate of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^WildfireSpeed]]`. Wildfires present two distinct dangers: fire/heat and smoke inhalation. Individuals that are actually within the flames of a wildfire must Save v. Death for every round they are exposed, taking `dice: 1d6` points of damage on a failed save and half that on a successful save. Immunity to normal fires is enough to reduce the damage to 0, but it doesn’t prevent smoke inhalation.  The smoke from a wildfire obscures vision by [[Filling in the Blanks#^SmokeVision]] within a range of half the size of the fire (thus, the smoke from a wildfire that is two subhexes large will obscure vision to a range or one subhex around the fire). All travelers within the smoke cloud must Save v. Poison for every turn they are within the cloud. Failure indicates they take `dice: 1d4` points of damage from smoke inhalation. Taking precautions, such as soaking a rag in water and putting it over one’s mouth and nose, grants a +2 bonus to the save but does not mitigate obscured vision. Those that fail a save are unable to cast spells for one turn after the failed save. |
| 13-24       | . Lightning strike. A thunderstorm brings lightning to the area. The storm lasts for `dice: 1d12` turns, and for each turn there’s `dice: 1d100 <=1` chance that a random member of the party is struck by lightning. Targets hit by lightning must Save v. Wands, taking `dice: 6d6` points of damage on a failed save and half on a successful save. Targets wearing metal armor save with a –2 penalty. Thunderstorms come on quickly, giving the adventurers only `dice: 2d20` minutes to find shelter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 25-36       | . Tornado. A tornado rips through the area, knocking over small trees, sending debris flying, and damaging buildings. Tornadoes travel at [[Filling in the Blanks#^tornadospeed]]. All of those within [[Filling in the Blanks#^tornadorange]] must Save v. Death for every round they’re within the radius, taking `dice: 1d6` points of damage from flying debris on a failed save and half on a successful save. Creatures smaller than a Man (excluding dwarves) must roll less than or equal to their Strength on [[Filling in the Blanks#^tornadoStay]]  or be flung a number of feet equal to the radius of the effect plus`dice: 2d20` feet, taking `dice: 1d6` points of damage for every ten feet they are thrown. The adventurers have `dice: 1d20` minutes warning of a tornado. If they take shelter in a low-lying area (such as a ditch) they gain a +2 bonus to saves and roll twice for any Strength checks, taking the better of two results. If this result occurs in an inappropriate area (such as a mountainous region) reroll if desired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 37-48       | . Flash flooding. Mostly dangerous if the adventurers are in a low-lying area, flash floods come on suddenly, up to `dice: 1d10` hours after a heavy rain. Those caught in flash floods only have `dice: 2d20` rounds to get to safety, due to how quickly they arrive. If not able to get to safety all within the flood must Save v. Wands twice; the first is to maintain footing, the second to avoid taking damage. If the first save is failed the second is made with a –2 penalty. Those caught in a flash flood take `dice: 2d8` points of damage if the second save is failed and half that on a successful save. Additionally, all those who loose their footing must roll less than or equal to their Strength on `dice: 4d6` or be swept `dice: 5d100` feet downstream, taking `dice: 1d6` points of damage for every 50 feet.

The adventurers are surprised on a roll of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ambushSurprised]]` unless otherwise noted in the monster’s description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 21          | Chaos Storm. An artifact of the magical energy that permeates the world of Absalom, Chaos storms are rare events that have the potential to change the very landscape of the world itself. In Nadirs (when the forces of Chaos are ascendant) Chaos storms are more prevalent, occurring on a roll of 21 and 55-60. When a Chaos storm occurs, roll to determine what it alters: [[Filling in the Blanks#^ChaosstormWhatAltered]] [[Filling in the Blanks#^FeatureNoLairs]] If the result is Geologic, Terrain, or Water roll to determine what the feature is. This feature is instantly introduced into the area affected. If the result is Resource a randomly determined resource (see p. 37) is either `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^introducedremoved]]` If the result is Magic roll in the Magic section and apply the result to the area. The onset of a Chaos storm causes headaches and goosebumps in all those within the affected area roughly `dice: 1d6` turns before the storm strikes. The only way to avoid being affected by the storm, while remaining in this area, is to take shelter in some form of magic-negating spell, such as an anti-magic shell or similar. |
| 22-50       | Disease. A disease is present in the area, usually carried by insects or in the water. All travelers passing through this hex have to make a Save against Poison to avoid the disease. Failure indicates the individual contracts the disease. The disease can be selected from another source (OSRIC describes some options on p. 131), drawn from the examples in monster entries (such as the disease that giant rats carry), or they can be designed as follows. [[Filling in the Blanks#Diseases]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 51-54       | Gas Pockets. Gasses vent or gather in the location, posing a danger to travelers. There’s `dice: 1d6 <= 3` 6 chance that the presence of the gas has a tangible manifestation that can potentially be noticed, such as dead animals or plants, discoloration, strange smell, etc. There’s `dice: 1d6 <= 3` chance the gas is not permanent but is instead released every `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^gasPocketInterval]]` Roll again to determine how long the cloud remains before dispersing. Gas pockets cause `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^GasPocketEffect]]`. The cloud of gas has a radius of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^gasRadius]]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Magical features are broken into several categories, but they all share several broad traits: Unless otherwise stated magical features cannot be dispelled by anything short of a wish or divine intervention. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a magical feature always occur. A zone where spells have their range increased by 25% *always* increases their range by 25%. The magic affects `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^magicarea]]`There’s `dice: 1d6<=2` chance that, when subjects of a magical effect leave the affected area, the effect ends. This applies to effects such as curses, but also more permanent effects, like the sentience of animals, which may find themselves reverting to their normal intelligence should they leave the magical area. |

### Sign


Potential encounters in adjacent hexes will often leave signs of their presence (note that this covers both monsters and other inhabitants, including Men). When this result is rolled determine which monster has left the sign using Figure 3, below. On a roll of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^signHex]]`. If the sign is from the secondary ring roll `dice: 1d6`, with 1 equaling “a”, 2 equaling “b”, etc. If in the tertiary ring roll `dice: 1d12`, with 1 equaling “a”, 2 equaling “b”, etc. Refer to p. 8 of Hexcrawl Basics to determine the range of various monsters. [[Sign Hexes.png]]. It is up to the Referee to determine the nature of the sign, but it should be a non-dangerous (i.e. it won’t hurt the PCs) clue to what type of threat may lurk nearby. The clue may be relatively obvious, or subtle, but the PCs should be able to easily discover it.. There’s `dice: 1d20<=1` chance that a sign will have been left by a transient creature – i.e. one that has passed through and moved on.. Careful examination will reveal that signs are `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^signage]]`. The easiest way to determine which monster left the sign, besides just picking one, is to roll on the wandering monster table. See p. for more information about setting up wandering monster tables.

### Dungeons

Dungeons are, in this context, structures containing **two or more** rooms with more than one type of monster lairing within, that must be explored in order to eliminate threats/gain treasure. Dungeons can either be open or closed. The inhabitants of open dungeons are free to leave, to hunt, trade, explore, etc. They are living communities that can potentially change over time, especially if the adventurers only partially clear them out. Closed dungeons are sealed off somehow, whether by seals, traps, magic, etc. They typically are closed ecosystems, with inhabitants either living off what can be produced within the dungeon (or brought from deeper within the earth), or not needing sustenance (undead or constructs). For purposes of populating hexes this book assumes a difference between monster lairs and dungeons. The number and population of monster lairs are determined separately from the inhabitants of dungeons. There are multiple other resources, including the OSE core, that can be used to design and populate a dungeon. However, the following are general guidelines that can be used to generate a dungeon’s basic framework. The rules below use the following assumptions: Most dungeons will be populated with lower-level threats. Most dungeons will be small, with only 2-10 rooms. The entry level of the dungeon will contain monsters and challenges appropriate to a `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^dngnlvl]]`.  In Wilderness hexes the Referee may choose to add +10 to the above roll. When appropriate the “level” of a dungeon will be referred to as the Challenge Rating. Therefore, a dungeon with a CR of 3 is appropriate for a party with an average level of 3. The dungeon is going to contain the following number of chambers `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^dngnnrChambers]]` In Wilderness hexes the Referee may choose to add 5 to cthe above roll. These chambers are the total number of rooms within a dungeon, divided amongst the different levels in some fashion. For every ten rooms in a dungeon there’s a 5% chance there is another level, with the remaining rooms in the dungeon occupying the lower levels. This chance should be rolled consecutively for each set of ten rooms. Ex. While creating a dungeon the roll to determine the number of chambers is 78, which means there are 6d10 rooms in the dungeon. The result of that roll is a 31. The first level contains a minimum of 10 rooms, after which we roll `dice: 1d100`  for every 10 additional rooms. We get a 4 on the second roll, which means that the first level contains 10 rooms before entering the second level. The second floor will contain at least 10 rooms (out of the remaining 21), and at this point we keep adding rooms ten at a time and rolling `dice: 1d100`. We don’t hit our 1-5% chance, so the dungeon consists of two levels; the first has 10 rooms and the second has 21. Every level in a dungeon has `dice: 1d6 <=1`  chance of being linked to a sub-level. Sub-levels are sort of “bonus” floors. One of the defining features of sub-levels is that they have limited access; usually only from one floor and, in many cases, the entrance to the sub-level is hidden, trapped or otherwise inaccessible. When determining the number of rooms a sub-level contains roll `dice: 3d20` and compare the result to the table above. These rooms are considered additional to the number of rooms in the dungeon, and are not counted when determining when to roll for additional levels. The dungeon will have one entrance, with `dice: 1d6 <=2` chance of an additional entrance for every fifteen rooms it possesses. Therefore, a dungeon with thirty rooms has a minimum of one entrance and a maximum of three entrances.

### Terrain
This result indicates the terrain for a given area (single sub-hex, random number of subhexes, or the entire hex) will be different from the pre-determined terrain. Some common terrain types are listed below, grouped into like categories.

| 01-50       | Within one degree. The basic terrain type remains the same with a slight change. For instance, farmland, grazing land, grasslands, shrublands and savannas are all flat, relatively treeless terrains that are within one degree of one another. Likewise, a hill could be barren, grassy, or forested and still be within one degree of the basic “hill” type. |     |
| 51-85       | Within two degrees. An area of a grasslands hex could be hilly, or an area of a hilly hex could be mountainous, but a mountain still wouldn’t be found in the middle of a flat plain.                                                                                                                                                                           |     |
| 86-95       | Unusual. This is an unusual feature that is non-magical in nature but rarely seen. `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^TerrainUnusual]]` If the existing terrain doesn’t fit with the feature, roll again.                                                                                                                                                                           |     |
^TerrainVariance

The area the terrain change encompasses is determined as follows `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^terrainArea]]`. The specific area affected by the changed terrain can be chosen by the Referee or determined randomly, as follows. Roll as normal to determine which hex or subhex is the starting hex for the changed terrain, then roll below to determine which adjacent hexes, if any, are also changed, assuming that more than one hex or subhex is included in the altered area. Refer to the sample map on p. 57 for assigning numbers to the hex faces. `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^nexthex]]`

| 1-50        | Roll `dice: 1d6` and determine which face is the adjacent hex. Continue to do this until there are no more hexes left to place.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 51-90       | Fill in the starting hex. Roll `dice: 1d6` to determine the adjacent hex, then continue to fill in the hexes in a  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^nextHexDirections]]` direction.                                                                                                                           |
| 91-100      | Fill in the starting hex. Roll `dice: 1d6` to determine the adjacent hex. Continue in a straight line, rolling a `dice: 1d6` each time. When the result comes up a 1, stop and refer back to the original hex, rolling `dice: 1d6` again to choose an adjacent hex and repeating the process. |
^nexthex

Terrain Feature Example. Subhex 0406 has a terrain change. The first `dice: 1d10`0 result is a 10, which means the change is within one degree of difference. If we assume the majority of the hex is light forest, let’s call this terrain change heavy forest. Rolling again, the result is a 31; so `dice: 1d4`+1 subhexes are affected. Rolling `dice: 1d4`, we determine that 3 subhexes are affected.

Rolling `dice: 1d10`0, the result indicates we will use the first method for allocating the changed terrain among subhexes. Beginning at subhex 0406 the first `dice: 1d6` roll is a 2, indicating that subhex 0505 is the next affected subhex, and the result after that is a 4, meaning that subhex 0506 is the third to be affected.

| 100         | Magical/magically  created  terrain. This  category  includes  things  like  fungal  forests, fields of flowers that magically put those walking through them to sleep, areas where gravity  is  increased  or  decreased,  etc. The  terrain  itself  could  have  a  magical  effect  – for instance, it could be a null-magic zone, where no magic functions – or it could be obviously magically created, such as an entire hex where the ground has been turned into bright green glass. Regardless, the terrain type here is both clearly out of place and clearly artificial/magical in nature. |

### Settlements
[[202211150936 Random Village]]
[[202211151038 Random City]]
[[WWN Tribes and exiles]]

This category is used to outline the settlements that exist in a hex. It is up to the Referee how to place these urban centers. This section may be used only to place settlements in Borderlands and/or Wilderness hexes, or it could be used to place all of the settlements in the campaign world. Note that this section uses the rules for urban centers described in the free book Domain Building.

Regardless, some care must be taken when placing settlements. They should be placed in appropriate locations: if there is a river or body of water in a hex, the settlement should be near the body of water, for instance. If random rolls indicate that more than one settlement exists in a single 6-mile hex the decision must be made to explain why that is, or whether the multiple settlements would be better served combined into a single center.

Likewise, when a settlement is placed on the map some thought should go into the infrastructure needed to support the settlement. The larger the settlement, the more infrastructure – farms and ranches, roads, keeps, etc. – is needed to support it. Is the settlement part of another domain, or is it an independent domain itself?

An assumption is made that in Civilized domains there is a settlement in each hex. These common settlements typically range in size from Market Classes 1 to 3; they’re small, relatively inconsequential villages and hamlets that exist mostly as background noise unless they are needed to serve a particular purpose – as the setting for an adventure, or perhaps an important NPC lives there.

As the percentages are determined now, each hex has `dice: 1d20 <=1` chance per feature of having a settlement in it. Depending on how densely populated the campaign world is the Referee may want to reduce the chances of a settlement in Borderlands or Wilderness hexes. It is suggested that when the Settlement result is rolled in these hexes that an additional `dice: 1d6` is rolled. In Borderland hexes if the result is a 1-5 there is a settlement present. If the result is a 6 there is no settlement, and the feature result is re-rolled. In Wilderness hexes `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^SettlementsWilderness]]`
The presence of a settlement has the potential to change a hex designation. The larger the settlement, the less likely it is to be found in Wilderness or Borderland hexes. One solution would be to modify the map to add a new domain. Another would be to assume the settlement is unable to project the power needed to pacify the surrounding territory. Perhaps it is an ancient city in decline, fallen into decadence and infighting, or perhaps it simply doesn’t have the resources needed to tame the surrounding lands.
Additionally, settlements in Wilderness hexes `dice: 1d6 <=1` chance of being abandoned by their original residents. Those in Borderland hexes have `dice: 1d10 <=1` chance of being abandoned.
When first determining the size of a settlement  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^SettlementSizeMaster]]`. The settlement will primarily be composed of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^settlementorigin]]`.

The above proportions can be changed based upon the abundance or scarcity of different races in the Referee’s campaign. The exact composition of the settlement is left up to the Referee’s discretion.

### Water

Water will be one of the most common features in most hexes, except for dry or arid regions. If this category is rolled in the following terrain types: 
Desert  `dice: 1d6 <=4` chance: there is no water, but rather evidence of previous water; dusty lakebeds, dry canyons where rivers used to run, etc. 
Badlands, `dice: 1d6 <=2` chance: there is no water, but rather evidence of previous water; dusty lakebeds, dry canyons where rivers used to run, etc.
Broken Lands,  `dice: 1d6 <=2` chance: there is no water, but rather evidence of previous water; dusty lakebeds, dry canyons where rivers used to run, etc.
Arid Plains or  `dice: 1d6 <=2` chance: there is no water, but rather evidence of previous water; dusty lakebeds, dry canyons where rivers used to run, etc.
Arid Hills,  `dice: 1d6 <=2` chance: there is no water, but rather evidence of previous water; dusty lakebeds, dry canyons where rivers used to run, etc.

In addition, results should be adjusted downwards to reflect the terrain type: creeks, ponds and lakes are much less common in certain arid climates and will almost always be either springs/oases or bodies of water than are only present during certain parts of the year (the rainy season, summer when higher elevation snows melt, or during the occasional rainstorm).

There are two broad types of water features that will be found within a hex: `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^waterMaster]]`

Flowing water includes things like creeks, rivers and streams, while still bodies are springs, ponds, lakes, etc. In most cases still bodies will be fed by one or more flowing bodies of water, but not in all. An underground spring might feed a small pond with no outlet, the rate of water evaporation keeping up with the speed at which water is added.
Most land that is relatively habitable (outside of those listed above) will have multiple sources of water within a single hex. It is outside the scope of this supplement to place all of the small creeks, springs, brooks, and ponds that will be found in 32 square miles (or however large your hexes are). Most sources of water, therefore, are handwaved; streams and brooks easily forded, springs marked on the map but otherwise ignored, etc. It can easily be assumed that in most areas there will be plenty of water sources that can be used to fill waterskins and slake the thirst of mounts and adventurers.
The thrust of this section, therefore, is to identify water sources of note within a hex.

#### Flowing Water

As a general rule of thumb you can step across a brook, jump across a creek, wade across a stream and swim across a river. Some other basic rules apply: water will typically flow towards a larger body of water, and downhill, with smaller courses of water generally joining up to form larger bodies of water.

The water feature will be a  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^FlowingSize]]`

A moving body of water will typically be no deeper than one quarter its width. A brook that is a foot wide will be, on average, three inches deep, while a river that is 100 feet wide will be no more than 25 feet deep in the middle. The wider a river is the shallower it will be proportionally, unlike the smaller bodies of water, and narrow rivers have a tendency to be deeper than wider rivers. Streams that are wider than 9 feet are typically only navigable via canoe or extremely small watercraft. Rivers that range from 10-30 feet wide are only navigable by canoes or other small, shallow draft craft. Most rivers can be plied by flat bottom craft or rafts; those deeper than fifteen feet or so can be sailed by boats with keels. As a general rule, boats can sail on waters with a minimum depth of four times the boat’s draft without worrying about grounding.
As a general rule moving bodies of water will be freshwater, although there’s `dice: 1d6 <=1` chance there’s something unusual about the waterway: It is  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^unusualWater]]`

While to some degree the direction of flow of a watercourse will be determined by the geography, the Referee can also randomly determine the direction of flow using the rules presented in the Roads section on p.23

`dice: 1d6 <=5` bodies of moving water have a special feature, drawn from the list below. Note that these features are usually `dice: 1d6 <=5` only found in specific sections of the waterway (i.e. where they are generated), but there is a chance that these traits are exhibited over the entire length.

Note that the term “river” is used below to describe any moving body of water, regardless of size. Roll once per river to determine a defining feature `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^RiverFeature]]`



#### Still Water

Even though large bodies of water such as seas and oceans are anything but still, they are still classified in this category, which is largely defined as bodies of water bordered by land- 
Roll below to determine the size of the body of water: `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^largestillwater]]`. If the Referee has already placed large bodies of water and coastlines, the range in parenthesis can be used to ignore the larger bodies of water `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^smallStillWater]]`


There is `dice: 1d5 <=5`chance any body of water has an unusual feature, drawn from the list below. The size of these features is, unless otherwise stated, determined by the size of the body of water. As a general rule, if the body of water is one hex or smaller the feature will occupy `dice: 1d20` subhexes. If it is between one and four hexes it will occupy `dice: [[Fill^sizestillwaterfeature1-4Hexes]]`. Any larger than that and the feature will occupy `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^sizestillwaterfeaturelarge]]`

Alternatively, the Referee can roll for each subhex or hex, with each having`dice: 1d6 <=1` chance of possessing one of the following features. `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^stillwaterFeatures]]`

Bayous are swamps, difficult to navigate on foot, but teeming with wildlife, thick foliage, and plentiful insects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 11-20      | Dry bed. The source of water has `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^driedUp]]` leaving a dried riverbed behind as evidence it once existed. If it has dried up there’s `dice: 1d6 <=1` chance that the source of the water is actually being blocked by something – perhaps a beaver dam, or something more nefarious. If the source is not being blocked there’s `dice: 1d6 <=2` chance – increased to `dice: 1d6 <=3` for arid climates – that the source of the water is seasonal or weather dependent; it either flows only `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^seasonalRiver]]`. Depending on how long ago the river vanished the bed will be in varying states of overgrowth; the longer ago it occurred the more likely the bed will be difficult to spot, and is in the process of being filled in through erosion.

| 58-60      | Rapids. The river picks up speed as it runs downhill, creating turbulence in the water. The rapids are `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^Rapidlength]]`. They are dangerous to navigate. When entering rapids by boat, an attack roll is made as follows: Roll to attack when the boat first enters the rapids, every mile thereafter, and when it leaves the rapids. The attack roll is made as a `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^RapidHD]]`. Each successful “attack” does `dice. 2d6` points of damage to the boat. Failed attacks still do 1 point of damage, unless a natural 1 is rolled, in which case the boat suffers no damage. Ex. The adventurers’ canoe enters a stretch of rapids that is 1⁄4 mile long. An attack roll is made twice; once when they enter and once when they leave. If the rapids were two miles long, four attack rolls would be made. Skilled outdoorspeople steering the craft can raise the boat’s AC by `dice: 1d6` (depending on the Referee’s judgment. Each time an attack is made those within must Save v. Petrification with a +2 bonus. Failure indicates the individual falls overboard. Adventurers that fall overboard suffer `dice: 1d4` points of damage from the buffeting water and have their chance of drowning increased by 25%.

A bay will typically have at least one river feeding into it. If settlements are present they will be found by a river on a roll of `dice: 1d6 <=5`, as rivers offer a source of freshwater and the potential for easy trade with the interior. A bay will have a mouth that is `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^baymouth]]`. Bays tend to be around `dice: 10d20` feet deep.

It is a `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^trenchshape]]`and occupies an area proportional to the size of the body of water. A trench in a pond may only be ten feet in diameter, while one in an ocean may stretch for multiple hexes. At great depths water behaves strangely, and there’s`dice: 1d6 <=3` chance that there’s something magical about the trench. Refer to the section on Magic to expand upon this.

| 88-93       | . Treacherous Currents. The currents in this section of the body of water run counter to prevailing currents. They reduce ship movement by `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^currents]]` while a ship remains in the area. There’s `dice: 1d6 <=1` chance the currents are strong enough that the ship, barring exceptional piloting or magical assistance, cannot escape the currents and must travel in the indicated direction. If the currents pull towards land, or a shoal, there’s a chance the ship will run aground (see above).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Perhaps it is a pocket of freshwater in an otherwise salt-water sea, or perhaps the water is warmer or colder than the rest. It may be a dead zone, where there is no oxygen and no living things (although there may be undead!).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 1-8         | Beneficial.  Even if not sentient, the animals act in ways that either help or hinder travelers through the area. Initially, this means that all reaction rolls with the designated animals are made with a modifier of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^reactionRollMod]]` . There’s `dice: 1d6 <= 4` chance that this modifier will not change, regardless of the actions of the adventurers. Killing one of the animals will not impose a penalty, nor will feeding them. Additionally, there’s`dice: 1d6 <= 3` chance that the animals act in an unnatural manner that can be construed as helpful or harmful. If the animals are not sentient or capable of communication their attempts may likely be rudimentary; if helpful, perhaps they seek to warn the adventurers away from a particular hazard, or the lair of a monster. If harmful, perhaps they try to lead the adventurers on a chase ending at the edge of a cliff, or into the lair of said monster. Magical communication can certainly be helpful, but if baneful the animals may choose to not answer, or even to deceive.   |

| 17-32       | Awakened. Awakened. Distinct from those that are sapient, Awakened animals are not only possessed of intelligence potentially equal to, or even surpassing, that of Man, but of mannerisms and characteristics of the humanoid races. Awakened creatures can walk on two legs, if their anatomy allows it, and their extremities are altered slightly to allow the use of tools. Awakened animals can be found wearing the garb and accoutrements of Man, and acting as Men do. They will, however, typically have no change in size; Awakened mice are still the size of mice. They will have an Intelligence score of `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^awakendIntel]]` . There’s a further `dice: 1d6 <=2` chance the Awakened creatures will be able to communicate via speech. This chance increases by 1 should their Intelligence be 13 or higher. Overall, Awakened creatures are  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^plantalignment]]`, although exceptions may exist among multiple creatures of the same kind, just as it does within a population of Men.. Awakened animals can possess racial class levels. |

They have the same chance of speech as Awakened animals; otherwise, there’s `dice: 1d6 <=3` chance the animals can communicate via `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^plantspeech]]`. The animals have a chance to possess spell-casting abilities dependent upon the number of affected individuals, as follows: All animals. 1 in 100, equivalent caster level `dice: 1d4`. Single species of animals. `dice: 1d3` in 100, equivalent caster level `dice: 1d6`. Small number of animals. `dice: 1d3` in 100, equivalent caster level `dice: 1d8`. A single animal. 1 in 10, equivalent caster level `dice: 1d10`. If this is the case, the animals can cast spells as a `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^plantCaster]]`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The size difference is `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^sizediff]]` Animals that are smaller than normal have reduced HD, typically proportionate to the decrease in size. A black bear, typically with 4 HD, that is 50% smaller than normal would have 2 HD. Likewise, the larger a creature is the more HD it has, by the same proportions: a black bear that normally has 4 HD that is 50% larger will have 6 HD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 16-30       | . Life. The area is either `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^banefulbeneficial]]` to life. If it is baneful, living creatures within its influence lose 1 hp per  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^dayHourTurn]]`. If it is beneficial, living creatures gain 1 hp per `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^dayHourTurn]]`. The reverse is true of any undead within the zone (i.e. they suffer damage when in beneficial zones and heal in baneful zones). There’s a `dice. 1d6 <=2` chance that healing magic is minimized within baneful areas (healing spells or effects restore the minimum amount) or maximized in beneficial areas (healing spells or effects restore the maximum amounts). Further, in beneficial zones there’s `dice. 1d6 <=2` chance that the healing just does not stop; it can exceed the maximum, and when a creature’s hp reaches its maximum plus 10 the creature dies. There’s `dice. 1d6 <=3` chance that plant-life is not affected by this magic. Living creatures slain by this magic have `dice. 1d6 <=1` chance of returning as a random sort of undead: `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^d10undead]]` |

There is `dice: 1d6<=4` chance that the feature only affects spells cast within the area, not those that already exist that are then brought into the area. The duration of spells is modified by `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^durmod]]`                                                      |
| 14-26 | Have  ranges  `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^incdec]]`. Ranges Increased/Decreased. The range of a spell is increased or decreased by a given amount. If the spell has a range of 10’ or less it is reduced to touch. If a spell has a range of touch it is reduced to personal only. Spells with a range of personal can be cast as normal. Modified by `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^durmod]]`                                                  |

Spells that have an area of effect called out in feet or yards have this amount modified according to the table for duration: `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^durmod]]` Ex. The web spell creates a 10’ cube of sticky material. If this spell is cast in a location where the area of effect is increased by 50% it would fill a 15’ cube. |
| 40-53 | Have variables `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^incdec]]`. Variables Increased/Decreased. Increase or decrease all of the variables of a spell by `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^variableStep]]`. Ex. A cleric casting cure light wounds in an area that increases by one die category would roll `dice: 1d8` instead of `dice: 1d6`. Ex. A magic-user casting mirror image summons `dice: 1d6` illusory duplicates instead of `dice: 1d4`.          |
| 54-67 | Have variables `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^maxmin]]`. Variables Maximized/Minimized. Spells that have a variable effect have their results maximized or minimized. A fireball, therefore, does either 1 hp of damage per die or 6 hp per die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 82-90 | Are `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^castdiff]]`. Easier/Harder to Cast. Magic is partially unbound or suppressed in an area, making it easier or harder to cast spells. Whenever a character attempts to cast a spell they must roll less than or equal to their primary attribute (Int for magic-users, Wis for clerics, etc.) on 3d6 plus the level of spell being cast. Ex. Casting a 3rd-level spell requires a roll of 3d6+3. In areas where casting is more difficult, failure indicates that the spell simply is not cast. On a roll of 1-4 the spell `dice: 1d6<=4` slot is expended, on a roll of 5-6 `dice: 1d6<=2` it is not. In areas where casting is easier, a successful roll indicates the spell is cast but a spell slot is not expended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 91-93 | Are `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^supprenh]]`. Suppressed/Enhanced. Spells that are suppressed simply do not take effect if cast within the area. If the spell was cast previous to entering the area it is suppressed upon entering. If a spell is suppressed it `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^expired]]`. Spells that are enhanced have their effects roughly doubled. This is up to the Referee to adjudicate. Note that it does not affect any of the above variables. Therefore, a hold portal spell would have the same duration and range, but a door held by such a spell could only be opened by a creature of 6 or more HD. A shield spell would grant the caster an AC of 2 (against missile attacks) or 4 (against other attacks).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 94-95 | Null-magic. Note that wild magic and null magic results are singular, canceling all other results. Null Magic. Magic cannot be cast within the area. Spells that are cast within the zone either `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^nullmagicinzone]]`. Spells or magical effects that are active before entering the area are `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^nullmagicentering]]`. This affects spell-like abilities that certain creatures might possess (such as the petrifying gaze of a basilisk) as well as creatures that are animated by magic (undead, or golems). Spell-like abilities are never destroyed (a basilisk regains its ability to petrify upon leaving the effect), while creatures animated by magic are destroyed upon entering a null magic zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 76-95  | Distance between points is distorted, taking `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^incdec]]` time to move between. Distance is Distorted. The spatial relationship between any two points is distorted and malleable. Those familiar with the terrain can move between points easily, while those unfamiliar with this effect find it takes longer to reach their destination. There are two effects of this: Those familiar with the area have their base movement increased by `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^movementdistorted]]` Those unfamiliar have their movement rate reduced by the same amount (to a minimum of 0’ per round). However, there is `dice: 1d6<=1` chance that those familiar with the area can actually travel between the warp and weft of space and time, teleporting `dice: [[Filling in the Blanks#^teleport]]` in any direction in lieu of their normal movement. This movement is instantaneous and allows them to move in any direction they can see. |
