### Roller
Based on the film of the same name written and directed by Michael Mann, this adventure generator builds on the idea of a powerful entity `dice: [[Evil Power wants to escape its prison generator#^entity]]` intent on breaking free from its prison `dice: [[Evil Power wants to escape its prison generator#^prison]]`. One faction serves the entity in its imprisoned state `dice: [[Evil Power wants to escape its prison generator#^servitors]]` while another faction is set on freeing it`dice: [[Evil Power wants to escape its prison generator#^breakers]]`, perhaps inadvertently. The characters must deal with both these factions in order to either prevent the entity’s release, destroy the entity, or return it to its prison. `dice: [[Evil Power wants to escape its prison generator#^relics]]`
