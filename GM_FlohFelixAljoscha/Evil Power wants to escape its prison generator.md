Based on the film of the same name written and directed by Michael Mann, this adventure generator builds on the idea of a powerful entity intent on breaking free from its prison. One faction serves the entity in its imprisoned state while another faction is set on freeing it, perhaps inadvertently. The characters must deal with both these factions in order to either prevent the entity’s release, destroy the entity, or return it to its prison.
