[[Karvosti.pdf]] p 28: Chieftain Embersind’s new stronghold is located on the **Eanors’s southern shore** GEÄNDERT, built around the ancient Arch Bridge which, in Symbarian times, stretched across the river. **Since then, the riverbed has moved a few hundred meters to the north**, but the bridge itself remains where it has always been. It is almost two hundred paces long, supported by massive stone pedestals sunk deep into rocks and dirt. The houses near the bridge, and the marketplace located beneath it, were built in the traditional stone and wood fashion, with one notable exception: the Chieftain’s stronghold. The all but completed structure was designed and built by Master Aspelo, the Royal Architect of Ambria, who borrowed techniques and styles from the great palaces of his homeland and embellished his creation with details from both barbarian and Symbarian architecture. When finished, the fortress is supposed to be impossible to penetrate without razing the wall or breaking through the gates, as demanded by the ever more paranoid and incredibly wealthy chieftain.

Das Gebiet war früher auch nicht so sumpfig wie jetzt.
