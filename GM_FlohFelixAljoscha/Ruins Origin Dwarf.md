Dwarf traits

All dwarves encountered in Yndaros seem to have much in common.

-   Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increas-
    
    es by 2. Increase two other ability scores by 1.
    
-   Age. The dwarven life-cycle is not well known, but it seems that dwarves are allowed their independence by their second or third decade of life and remain active for
    
    at least a century.
    
-   Size.Dwarvesrangefromfourtofivefeetinheightand
    
    are solidly built but not stocky. Your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first level you have 8 hit points plus your Constitution modifier. When you gain a level in any class, you gain an additional Hit Die and 5 (1d8) plus your Constitution modifier hit points.
    
-   Speed. Dwarven legs do not permit the long strides of other folk. You have a base speed of 25 feet.
    
-   Absolute Memory. Dwarven memory is robust and com- prehensive. They can remember anything they choose to commit to memory at any time and can remember even incidental events up to a month after they occur.
    
-   Earth Bound. Dwarves are bound to the bones of the world. They have no soul – instead your current Cor- ruption total reduces your current and maximum hit points on a 1:1 basis. You do not roll for marks of Cor- ruption and if your total Corruption equals or exceeds your current hit points you become unconscious until your Corruption is reduced or your hit points increase (an unconscious dwarf counts as taking a short or lon- ger rest if they are undisturbed). If you acquire more permanent Corruption than your Corruption Threshold (see page 37) then your character is no longer play- able. If slain, they cannot become undead or be resur- rected. Even speak with dead fails.
    

• Pariahs. Dwarves are poorly understood or tolerated among other peoples. They have disadvantage on social checks with everyone other than fellow dwarves, elves and trolls.

• Languages. Dwarves usually speak the local human language, either Ambrian or Barbarian, but with much more sophistication, adding in a series of code words that enable two dwarves to have a secret conversation in public. Some near Davokar speak the language of trolls or elves as well.

Dwarf naMes

Judging by the dwarves living in Yndaros, they have a fond- ness for names which contain many hard consonants, such as k, t and r. Aside from that, there seems to be no difference between male and female names: they are inherited with- in the family and between generations without concern for gender. All dwarves also have family surnames, just like the Ambrian nobles. However, it appears as if younger dwarves must earn the right to call themselves by their family name, preferably by impressing their relatives and making them proud.

• Dwarf Names: Artek, Bolkor, Brana, Dobril, Dranek, Dusa, Jarok, Lazek, Margor, Mirek, Radmil, Stana, Vesnek, Vlador, Yaruk


Dwarf Backgrounds

Dwarves who choose or are forced to leave their families in Yndaros are lonely and often dangerous individuals. How- ever, for some dwarves, the seclusion becomes the start of the search for a new family, defined by other characteristics than blood. The following reasons may explain why you have left Yndaros to head out into the world.

Dreams of Doom

You are haunted by nightmares of doom and death, for your family or the world as a whole. You have left the community to become a seeker, hoping to determine the meaning of your dreams and, ideally, learn how to avert the disaster and protect all your loved-ones.

clothes and 4d6 + 1 shillings.

Feature: Haunted

Your nightmares are sometimes prophetic. When you com- plete a long rest you gain a prophecy die, a d6. Before making a skill check, you can declare that something about the situ- ation reminds you of your dreams and add the d6 to the roll. You must do this before the GM declares the check a success or failure. You recover the die with a long or extended rest.

Suggested Characteristics

Constantly harried by terrible visions, these dwarves have cut almost all family ties. But their despondent freedom sometimes allows them to see the world in a new light.

Life-debt

An outsider has saved your life without asking for any- thing in return. You want to get free from this debt by serving the outsider and doing whatever he or she says. For a dwarf, this is an acceptable reason for being away from the family.

    clothes and 2d6 + 3 shillings.
    
    Feature: Driven
    
    Your obligation to repay the outsider gives untold resilience – to fail to repay a life-debt is the worst disgrace a dwarf could face. When you fail a saving throw you can choose to have a second chance at it, by rolling again (using any bonuses, penalties or extra dice as before). Once you use this feature you must take an extended rest before using it again.
    
    Suggested Characteristics
    
    Somehow you have acquired a life-debt and now owe some- one else your life, a nearly untenable position for you.


Outcast

You have behaved disloyally, maybe challenged the head of the family or questioned the family’s position in the order of succession. For this, you are banished, temporarily or permanently. To most dwarves, exile is a punishment worse than death.

• Skill Proficiencies (choose one): Deception or Persuasion • Tool Proficiencies (choose one): Any artisan’s tools

working clothes and 1d6 + 4 shillings.

A Spy

You are not exiled but pretend to be, with the intent of gaining access to secrets that the family needs. Alternatively, you may have been sent to perform some illegal deed, for instance hunting down a fugitive with a stronger claim to the dwarven crown than the character’s family.

You can choose to be a spy instead of an outcast as part of select- ing this background. Beware, of course, that taking this alternative too often will undermine the credibility of using the alibi.

Feature: Quick Learner

If you are asked to use a set of tools that you are not proficient in, you can easily determine the most efficient way to use them. You add a bonus equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to any ability checks made with the new tools.

Suggested Characteristics

Many outcasts struggle with their dependence on a world that does not make much sense to Dwarves. Some adapt better than others.
