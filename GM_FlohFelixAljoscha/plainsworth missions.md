![[Plainsworth.png]]

Plainsworth was once a small, prosperous town, owing its bustling commerce to sitting on an intersection of several Old Empire roads. Situated in the heart of the Aldermark breadbasket, the bounty of nearby villages flowed through it until it was on the verge of becoming a full-fledged city.

Now the hushed tones and shuttered windows of the residents project a sense of growing unease. Its inns, streets, and alleyways have refugees trying to keep out of sight and families fleeing the Cinder King’s advance.

The town has a small garrison, its own well, and the crumbling but serviceable remnant of the old Tantari wall made in the heyday of the Empire, providing a strong defensible position to the west and south. They’ve erected makeshift fortifications where needed, and trust the mountains and the Blackwood to help protect against assaults from the east and north.

As a small, provincial village, Plainsworth holds some of the Aldermani superstitions and dislike for Old Empire things, and this wariness extends to the Legion, whose roots are from there. The townsfolk have had problems with bandits and retreating soldiers taking what they want by force, so the populace is unsure if having a small, well-armed force is a blessing or a curse.

Nearby plains and villages may have supplies that may have to be wrested from undead. The forest and mountains to the southwest are dotted with a few crumbling holy sites. The roads leading into the village have a sporadic stream of families and a mix of straggling soldiers fleeing the front.

mission type: Assault favor: Mercy

An Infamous-led undead patrol has been doing nighttime raids on local settlements and capturing people, keeping them in cages. A nearby village that Plainsworth used to regularly trade with is currently being used to hold these captives before they are taken for undead conversion. A rapid raid would reunite local friends and families, likely net volunteers for the Legion, and provide insight into what the Broken were planning for them.

mission rewards: +2 Morale. 5 Rookie recruits. +1 Intel. mission penalties: -1 Morale.

mission type: Supply favor: Glory, Knowledge

Nearby is a storied place from the Legion’s history. The Tantari banner— the original symbol of the Legion’s authority—was lost when the Empire fell. It was granted to the Marshal of the Legion by the first Emperor. After the Breaking three years ago, one of the Broken set up a dig site to look for it. Undead have been spotted returning there. The mission is to finish the dig, while fending off any challengers.

mission rewards: +2 Morale. Relic: Tantari banner (the Marshal may choose to ignore the morale penalty of up to five deaths).

mission penalties: None.

mission type: Religious favor: Holy, Mystic, Mercy

Voyis Kariyevich, the Kingfisher Knight, is renowned for his skill in battle. He’s said to be cursed, and rather than inflict this on others, he retired nearby to the southern mountain range to spend his days in contemplation, tending a local holy site. If he could be swayed to join and be cleansed, his expertise in combat might would surely be a huge benefit to the Legion.

mission rewards: 1 Religious Supplies. All Specialists on the mission mark +2 xp. Specialist: Heavy (+2 actions).

mission penalties: None.
