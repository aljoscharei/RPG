You are a scholar, seeking the secrets of the universe, both magical and mundane. For they are often intertwined, and the philosophy of the order requires investigation, experience and evidence, which often puts you at odds with those who put all of their faith in Prios. But the Ordo is not wholly impractical, its leaders know that without the silver thaler of the nobles and the protection of the Sun Church and the Queen’s forces it could not safely seek out answers to its questions.
