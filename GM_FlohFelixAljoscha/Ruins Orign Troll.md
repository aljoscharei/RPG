troLL traits

Trolls form a unified society in the Underworld and their cultural tendencies show even in those who have chosen to explore the outer world.  
• Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases

by 2. Increase any other ability score by 1.  
• Age. Trolls are not born and thus don’t celebrate the pass-

ing of the years like other peoples. With the emphasis on competition, most trolls die well before they show any signs of aging.

• Size. Trolls average just at or below 8 feet in height and weigh 300 pounds or more. Your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first level you have 8 hit points plus your Constitution modifier. When you gain a level in any class, you gain an additional Hit Die and 6 (1d8) plus your Constitution modifier hit points (see below).

• Speed. Trolls have long limbs and take long strides. Your base speed is 40 feet.

• Darkvision. Accustomed to the Underworld, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

• Pariah. Humans are fearful of trolls so a troll making a check involving a human has disadvantage. A troll that succeeds at a Charisma (Intimidation) check involving one or more humans however will mean that the humans are frightened of the troll for one minute or until the troll leaves the immediate area (whichever comes first).

• Tough Skin. Trolls can withstand more hurt than most other creatures. When rolling for hit points, roll the Hit Die twice and use the higher result. If using the average result, use 6.

• Languages. Trolls have their own language, passed down from other trolls since the beginnings of the world. Those who wander often pick up Elvish and at least one of the human tongues in order to make themselves understood.




Troll Backgrounds

By traDition, troLLs are tightly bound to their societies and need more than common curiosity to head out into the world. Here follows a couple of examples or incentives which can drive a troll character to adventure beyond the domains of its kin:

Artifact Collector

The crafting skills of trolls are held in high esteem even among elves, and many troll-made artifacts have been given as gifts to allies – or been stolen by enemies. Trolls feel closely con- nected to everything crafted by their kind and it is important to them that such objects do not remain in the wrong place or in the wrong hands. The character is sent to collect one or more of these lost treasures, either from ancient tombs, Symbarian ruins or from unworthy, soon-to-be-dead thieves. • SkillProficiencies(chooseone):Insight,Investigation

or Perception  
• Tool Proficiencies: Any one set of artisan’s tools  
• Equipment:Supplies/toolstomatchyourtoolproficien-

cy, over-sized clothes and 4d6 + 6 shillings (troll minted, but usually taken at face value for the metal content and that arguing with trolls is unwise).

Feature: Inspector

You have made a comprehensive study of various styles and construction techniques. If you make a successful DC 15 Intel- ligence (Investigation) check of a manufactured item, you can identify which of the peoples made the item and might be able to make a guess about the specific community of the crafter.

Suggested Characteristics

You have made it your life’s work to recover the work of others. Sometimes you wonder if it might have been better to just make things yourself. You sometimes feel the call to take some rest and make something...



Journey of Discovery

Trolls usually send their young ones abroad to learn about the world and its creatures. The destination may vary, but the goal is always to come to terms with the powers which shape the world. Before, many traveled to the closest Iron Pact settlement, but nowadays humankind and above all the newly arrived Ambrians are as interesting, or more inter- esting, than the elves.

• Skill Proficiencies (choose one): Arcana, History, Med- icine or Religion

• ToolProficiencies(chooseone):Calligrapher’ssupplies, cartographer’s tools, painter’s supplies or herbalism kit

• Equipment: Supplies to match your tool proficiency, large clothes and 2d6 + 8 shillings.

Feature: Cunning Student

At the end of an extended rest, choose a skill that you are not proficient in. You have a bonus to that skill equal to half of your proficiency bonus rounded down. When you take another extended rest you must select a different skill, as your attention wanders to a new subject.

Suggested Characteristics

You are out in the world for the first time. Perhaps it will be the only time? The world seems both exciting and frighten- ing and one moment you wish you were home and another that you had unlimited time for your explorations.
