![[Western Front.png]]

Three years ago, a notable Aldermani battle against the Cinder King’s troops happened here, and more recently the armies of the Eastern Kingdoms built their fortified camp here before advancing to Ettenmark Fields.

The area remains marginally fortified and is a good place to regroup before pushing on. The few soldiers remaining here are exhausted and on edge, but know better than to start trouble with the well-armed and disciplined soldiers of the Legion. If you were hoping to find other Chosen that survived the offensive at Ettenmark, they are not present. Rumors abound that they’ve gone a grueling alternate way, taking the southern path to fight on a different front.

The main fortification of the front is the previous army’s rear camp. At night, you can still see the orange hue of the still-burning Karlsburg—the old capital of Aldermark—reflected on the clouds above it.

A few soldiers hold out behind the makeshift walls, pits, and barricades—most barely holding it together, with a few having fully given up. There’s a few days’ worth of supplies remaining for the handful of people left in the fort, with lots of talk in the shadows of abandoning the camp.

In the surrounding areas, undead have been crossing the Tigeria in increasing numbers. They test the camp defenses under cover of darkness, looking for a weakness to exploit. A brutal intelligence underlies their movements, looking to cut off avenues of escape.
