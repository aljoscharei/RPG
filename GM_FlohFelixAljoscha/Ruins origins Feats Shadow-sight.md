Some humans are sensitive to the ethereal echoes of Shadows and, when concentrating, can see them. If you take this feat, you can spend a bonus action and take 1d4 temporary Corruption to discern a creature’s Shadow, and judge it to be normal, blight-stricken, blight-marked or thoroughly corrupt (see page 38).
The Gamemaster will compare your passive Insight to the target’s passive Deception. If you fail, you see the creature’s normal shadow, as it looked before suffering any corrupting influences.
