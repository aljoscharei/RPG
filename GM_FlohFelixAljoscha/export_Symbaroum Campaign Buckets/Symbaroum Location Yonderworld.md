# Menschen sind Dämonen, Corruption kommt aus Yonderworld

Alle Menschen sind dämonen, exaltation nur bei menschen

Warum werden einige zu abominations, andere zu primal blight beasts, cryptwalker etc?

-   Es gibt in der  yonderworld verschiedene species und diese unterschiede sind vererbt worden
    
-   Je nach leben/Handlung wird man etwas anderes (cooler aber unlogischer), warum dann so viele abominations
    
-   Dämon in yonderworld ist formlos oder wird bei übertreten in stoffliche welt erst form. Corruption öffnet portal und formloser dämon übernimmt und form körper
    
-   Geister etc gibt es auf in dieser welt. Variation kommt aus clash der dimensionen mit unvorhersehbaren und zufälligen konsequenzen
    
-   Corruption ist der Stempel den die menschendämonen auf der welt hinterlassen wenn sie die schleusen ihrer verdorbenen seele öffnen und so die Corruption aus der yonderworldhölle in die welt lassen. Vielleicht auch krankheit, die sie in die welt gebracht haben?
    
-   Tragisch-melancholisches World of Darkness Thema Vampire the Masquerade: Es gibt kein Heil, keine Erlösung weil die menschen nicht nur unwiederbringlich verdorben sind sondern selbst die verderber der Welt
    
-   ?Corruption zones in kern portale in andere welt ->mythic underworld? Seedpod in kartvosti: nadelstich in fabric of the world lochblende)
    
-   Es gibt zwei arten von Untoten: Willenlose Zobies durch druch Raise undead geschaffen werden und mächtige Untote, die in Kompliziertem Ritual geschaffen werden. Wenn sie einen starken Willen haben (ggf. Plus andere Qualifiers) können sie andere untote kontrollieren
    
-   Menschendämonen hinter masken regieren
    
-   Primal blight beast was sind die?
    
-   Andere Rassen können auch zaubern und korrupt werden. Dann sterben sie aber einfach und werden nicht zu Abomination.

the so-called yonderworld has already been hinted at, in spell descriptions provided in the Ruins of Symbaroum Player’s Guide. Still, we have to admit that we are as uncertain about it as Ambria’s intellectual elite, especially when it comes to the most contentious issue: whether it consists of a single world or multiple ones. And perhaps it is mostly an academic matter, as no one will likely stay in this (or these) world(s) long enough to map it all.

Venturing into the Yonderworld is to expose oneself to immense danger – anyone who knows anything about the subject agrees on that much. Going there blind, without some form of anchor or reference point on the other side, is even more reckless, or even suicidal. But in some cases the circumstances might leave the player characters without a choice, that the risk of the journey is outweighed by the potential reward, or that they expose themselves and/or others to even greater danger by not going.

History

Scholars of the most ancient days believe that the Yonderworld is the cradle of humankind, from which they escaped in giant ships of stone powered by mystical ceremonies. The reason for this escape should quickly become clear to anyone visiting the world in question: it is dead, ravaged by the monsters which the witches call blight beasts and the Ambrians abominations or daemons.

This world was not destroyed overnight, nor because of any one event. It was worn down over time; the humans violated nature to fight the Corruption they had already awoken, which only fed nature’s wrathful reactions to the point where the Corruption became overwhelming – you could say that the Yonderworld exceeded its Corruption Threshold. And at that point, the development became irreversible; the world was doomed and lost.

The history of the original human homeworld will be described further in future modules, not least in the final episodes of The Throne of Thorns. But this should not stop anyone from using the Yonderworld as an adventure location, if that seems desirable – it is an absolutely massive world (or possibly several worlds!), so even if your ideas should deviate from ours, it will almost certainly be possible to bridge such differences.

nature

Miles-long plains of sand and dust, in rolling dunes or accumulated into towering mountains, sometimes storm-swept, sometimes turned into mud by thunderous rain – as far as anyone can see, this is all that remains. The corruption is ever present, in the dust stirred up by your footsteps and constantly radiating in the background. The Gamemaster can use the table [[#Corruption in the Yonderworld]] to get an idea of just how much corruption is present.

However, for those with enough time to further explore the wasteland, or who know what to look for, there are interesting discoveries to be made. Hidden beneath the surface are the ruins of several great civilizations that rose and fell over the millennia. Some of these might even have been exposed by rain and wind, made visible to the naked eye and available for further investigation. But one must then have the courage and strength to defy the famished inhabitants of the Yonderworld, and possess some kind of antidote for the corruption, or it will quickly turn the find of a lifetime into a nightmare.

cuLtures

It would be misleading to say that any cultures exist in the Yonderworld. And as for the ruins which the player char- acters might be able to explore, you are free to design them in any style that seems appropriate.  
Some may be tempted by the thought of making the Yonderworld very similar to our own Earth – that there are buildings of glass, metal and concrete (much like the ones in our cities) hidden underneath the sand and dust. That will not be the case in our version of the Yonderworld, so in this instance you should be prepared to later use the idea that there is more than one world beyond the Davokar region. The level of civilization we have in mind is more similar to Ambria, or rather the ancient Symbarian Empire. 

creatures

There is nothing living in the Yonderworld, including its inhabitants. Sure, the daemon princes ruling the devastation are often powerful enough to rise above the pure, instinctual hunger of other abominations. Sometimes they even display something similar to rationality and cunning, but only those who were once human. Most creatures in the Yonderworld are just as furiously unreasonable as the primal blight beasts brought to life in humanity’s new homeworld.

Speaking about the new world, the daemon princes, the “exalted” humans, would like nothing more than to go there.

They try to trick cultists and sorcerers into letting them do just that, but are often themselves tricked or prevented from breaking free from the rituals’ control. Humans who make it to the Yonderworld and somehow find a way back out will often do so with daemonic company (intentionally or otherwise). It is therefore not surprising that dimensional travelers quickly attract the interest of the deserts’ rulers...

Adventure set-up

A demonologist performs a teleportation (or [[plane shift 8 friends also banish wc]]) , and on the way through the Yonderworld she glimpses a rectangular structure poking out of the otherwise rolling dunes of the desert. Shortly thereafter, she uses plane shift to go back there. As she enters the ruin’s antechamber she is overwhelmed by fear and anxiety causing her to turn back, but not before grabbing a strangely shaped metal object – one that she proudly displays to her colleagues upon her return.

A little later the demonologist contacts the player characters, directly or through an intermediary. The metal ob- ject has been stolen, probably by some envious rival. The problem is that the thief will be able to use the item to get to the ruin, and thereby become the first person to explore it – that must not happen!

The player characters are offered the job of escorting the quest giver to the ruin in the Yonderworld. The rival and her ruthless expedition is already on site, and will likely serve as a complication as the player characters explore the location. Perhaps the rival has already been kidnapped by a daemon prince; maybe one of her companions witnessed the abduction and reveals that the prince intends to force the poor human to bring him along on the journey back to Ambria.

## Other worlds and the origin of humans Katrandama's triptych
Folklore is full of tales of other worlds, parallel to the physical world that is the home of the living. Some of these myths also speak of the origin of humankind and there is a worrying pattern to the tales, a pattern indicating that humans stem from somewhere else; stuff of legend which has been granted support by the enormous stone ships found stranded in the far east, beyond the Ravens and the desert where a human empire – sometimes talked about as the First Empire – is said to have blossomed and died. From whence the humans once came to this world is not known, but the existence of other worlds is more or less an established fact, at least among scholars.

For mystics and others studying the subject there is no doubt that this world is only one of many. There have been attempts to establish a verifiable classification and one of the most talked about is Katrandama’s Triptych, named after a sorcerer who was burned to death in Kadizar in approximately year −24. Katrandama left notes and drawings behind regarding the composition of the world.

Before her, most mystics believed the cosmos to be divided in two: the world of the living, and an un-world inhab- ited by spirits and abominations. Katrandama crushed this dichotomous worldview and imagined that the worlds fitted together as the pieces of a three-part altarpiece, with the physical world in the middle and the wings made up of the Spirit World and the Yonderworld. Normally, the triptych is closed and all beings are caught within its frames, but aided by the powers of sorcery the wings can be pushed ajar and the gaps used as pathways between the worlds. Some speculate that the Corruption amassing in the world makes the triptych tremble and occasionally open up, allowing undead and abominations to enter where gaps occur.

According to the teachings of Katrandama, mystical rituals can also be understood in light of the three worlds. From the physical world comes the building blocks of both flaming servants and the undead raised by necromancers, but it also requires control over the Spirit World – the gray, barren land of ashes and lost spirits that borders Eternity, where no one alive may travel. Only spirits can enter the infinite void, after which not even they may return. The restless spirits and ghosts that spiritualists speak to and necromancers bend to their will travel the Spirit World.  
It takes the power of a god to send spirits back from the Eternity beyond the Spirit World’s borderland, just as Prios sends Patron Saints to his most loyal servants.

The Yonderworld is thought to be a mist-shrouded wasteland, easily mistaken for the Spirit World, yet vastly different: its nature is Corruption. Its fauna consists of abominations, from small Blight Spawns to ancient Blight Beasts of immense power. As stated by Katrandama, the Yonderworld is the world from which humankind fled to this one – an idea that very few mystics are prepared to accept and the Curia has deemed to be contentious and he- retical; the humans came over the eastern sea from another continent, fleeing from idol worshipers and sun haters – at least according to the official teachings of the Sun Church.
