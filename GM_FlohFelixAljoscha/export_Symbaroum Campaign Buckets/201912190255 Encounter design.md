Force movement. Keep players moving to avoid tank n spank. Warum: Abwechslung von ranged und melee monster Attacks.

*   Make them stack behind cover: line of sight or hail of arrows
*   Keep them from moving: attacks of opportunity 
*   Make them spread: area of effect attacks by enemies (fireball, swarm attacking square)
*   Lure them: healing bush
*   Tangling vines with archers atracking. Dex save whenever 1 squares from plant
*   Fear mechanic forcing to fleeing
*   Getting lost in underbrush while forest fire

Pace Resting attack gear, alternative damage

Perception checks for squares with special feature (bush, rock) ähnlich wie create advantage bei fate aber konkrete anwendung 

Fight in an enclosed space against big demon. Cut away to other pc who saw the door close (the wall come down etc) and will have to help out against a countdown.
