# 5: Cover and Line of Sight

**Crafting Combat Encounters with Cover**
Combat tactics become difficult when your battlemap just offers wide-open spaces.
You also make your combats treacherous for low-AC ranged attackers, because they become sitting ducks.
In this lesson, we'll show you how to add a few elements of cover to increase your creatures’ defense while also giving the party objectives to capture in the encounter.
**Cover Makes Combat Dynamic**
Environmental cover offers a shield from incoming ranged attacks. This makes being in control of the battlefield’s cover an advantageous position to have.
The side in control of the cover will fight to keep their foothold. The opposing side must fight to get control of the cover.
This situation creates a _King of the Hill_ style fight. Both sides vie for control of the cover or force the controlling side out from the cover.
Some cover can break line of sight. This is beneficial because line of sight is required for ranged attacks and spells.
To regain line of sight, the attacker must reposition. Oftentimes requiring them to step out into a disadvantageous position to attack.
Forcing the attacker to reposition may involve them drawing closer to your melee units, making them an easier target. The attacker could also move further away from their allies, creating gaps in the enemy line for your creatures to take advantage of.
**What is Cover?**
There are three types of cover in 5e:

*   **Half:** +2 to AC and Dexterity Saving Throws
*   **Three-Quarters:** +5 to AC and Dexterity Saving Throws
*   **Total:** cannot be targeted. Some AoE spells may be able to reach a target.

For more information on the cover rules, look no further than the _Player’s Handbook_ or [the SRD](https://5thsrd.org/combat/cover/).
The challenging part about cover is its implementation. For instance, what type of cover each element is.
Here are quick examples to help define each type:

*   **Half:** another creature, a felled tree, or a crate
*   **Three-Quarters:** a thick tree trunk, an arrow slit in a stone wall, or a [Blade Barrier](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Blade%20Barrier#content)
*   **Total:** a large boulder, a wall, or a closed door

Envision what the creature looks like from the perspective of the attacker. If they’re only obscured, then they’re behind half cover. If the attacker cannot see them, they’re behind total cover.
To determine line of sight, choose any corner of the attacker’s space on the battlemap. Draw an imaginary line or [use a laser pointer](https://shop.thearmypainter.com/products.php?ProductGroupId=5) between the attacker and the target. So long as that line, or any other line, does not pass through an area of total cover, the attacker has line of sight.
For more information reference the “Line of Sight” section on page 251 of the _Dungeon Master’s Guide._
**Including Cover in an Encounter**
The first step of creating an encounter is to determine the battlefield. This includes either drawing or using a premade battlemap.
Once you have your battlemap, consider what elements of the battlemap could be cover.
Most of the time, the natural cover in a battlemap is half or total cover as their classifications are the most lax. Three-quarters cover is a strict classification so it is rare to have added it unintentionally.
A forest is one combat location with plenty of natural cover. Thick trees are three-quarters cover, while felled trees and large rocks are half cover.
If your battlemap is lacking cover, start adding some. Consider what objects could both fit in the setting and be used as cover.
Try to add at least a couple of pieces of cover to each battlemap. Even two or three pieces of cover shakes things up and promotes tactical play.
**Using Cover in Combat**
Cover is easy to use come game night. Hide behind it and enjoy increased defenses. It’s also a versatile combat element with uses both on the offensive and defensive.
**Offensive Cover**
Ranged attackers can move behind cover after shooting. This includes stepping out from total cover, shooting, and then moving back behind cover.
Melee units can also use cover as they advance toward the party. Cover provides a safety net for melee creatures as they position themselves to strike.
**Defensive Cover**
Planting cover behind your creatures is a fantastic idea as it gives them the option to retreat.
Ranged units also have the option to drop back and lob attacks from afar while still gaining the benefits of cover.
In doing so they secure their own retreat while assisting your melee units, should they turn the fight back in their favor.
**Holding Points**
Bunkers, forts, and other structures are a specific type of defensive cover called holding points.
Holding points are the focal point of their encounter.
One side begins the fight within the holding point. This allows them to shoot from behind the safety of cover.
The opposing side must fight their way into the holding point or find a way to destroy it. They are at a severe disadvantage until they do so.
The script flips once the opposition claims the holding point. Now they have the cover while attacking their fleeing enemies or engaging with enemy reinforcements.
**Destroying Cover**
Cover, [like any object,](https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/objects/) is destructible. There’s even equipment such as the portable ram that is tailor-made for such a scenario.
Destruction costs resources such as spell slots or items. Yet, destroying cover rather than advancing upon it may save other resources such as HP in the long run.
Having the option to destroy cover adds yet another layer of decision-making to an encounter. You have many options to flush out an enemy that’s behind cover.
**Example: Goblins in the Forest**
Here’s a battlemap using the forest encounter scenario used earlier in the article:

![cover_high_res-png.1561](./resources/202107102148_FC5E_-_5__Cover_and_Line_of_Sight___Campaign_Community.resources/cover_high_res-png.1561)

_This battlemap was created with [Dungeon Painter Studio.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/592260/Dungeon_Painter_Studio/)_
Here are the types of cover in the above battlemap:
**Large rocks:** half cover
**Boulder:** total cover
**Trees:** three-quarters cover
The goblin’s Nimble Escape trait opens up a ton of options for us in a battlefield full of cover.
They can use a bonus action to disengage and run behind cover. They can also use a bonus action to hide behind cover and gain advantage on their next attack.
**More Dynamic, More Fun!**
Adding cover is one of the simplest ways to make combat encounters dynamic and engaging.
Cover is an objective for both sides of the battle. The side that controls the cover wants to keep it. The side that doesn’t wants to take it from the other side and use it.
This scenario has plenty of solutions. Adding layers of decision-making to the encounter. The party can destroy the cover, they can maneuver around it, they can rush up to it, or they can fight in spite of it.
Such a simple element adds so much depth to an encounter.

**Worksheet Activity - Draw a Battlemap with Cover**
For this activity, draw a battlemap that includes at least three elements of cover. Then, define what type of cover each element is and how creatures could use them during the encounter.
**Answer Key:**
_Cover rules cheat sheet for judging cover type:_
**Half Cover:** structures that provide some cover, but still gives enough of a shot for a ranged attacker.
**Three-Quarters Cover:** a structure that provides a considerable amount of coverage while still allowing creatures to attack from behind it.
**Total Cover:** Breaks line of sight. Creatures behind this cannot be targeted.
**How To Summary**

1.  Consider what elements already included could be used as cover
2.  Add more cover as needed

1.  Ranged attackers can duck behind cover after shooting
2.  Melee units can weave in and out of cover as they advance

1.  Place cover behind your creatures to give them a safe escape route
2.  Position ranged units further back behind cover

1.  King of the Hill style fight to hold or capture an area of dense cover
2.  Capturing the holding point reverses the roles of each side of the battle

1.  Spells, items, and equipment can be used to destroy cover
