# Demons and Cultists

Many of these models are from my personal collection of occultish fantasy miniatures for narrative tabletop skirmish gaming in 28mm. They were collected, converted and painted so that they can be used in different settings and with different rules systems (such as Rangers of Shadow Deep, Frostgrave, Mordheim, Warcry, or our house system Fabula).

Others were made on commission for various clients.
