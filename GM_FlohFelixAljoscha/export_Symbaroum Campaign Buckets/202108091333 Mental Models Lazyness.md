For humans, we have to be careful though, to make sure minimizing our energy output increases our effectiveness and doesn’t lead to laziness.

There is a significant increase in survival potential for organisms that develop efficiency in handling the ongoing, repetitive requirements of their environments. Change is costly for most organisms.

It can be easier to keep doing whatever has guaranteed their survival so far than to try something new that might fail and waste energy or endanger them. The instinct to minimize energy output can lead us to be resistant to change or risk-taking. Using this model as a lens help us better understand our default thinking tendencies, and how our patterns of movement i
Impact our physical environments.

Desire Paths Cutting through forests and fields, snow and debris, are paths created by the feet of people who wanted to get between two points as efficiently as possible. Our tendency to minimize our energy output means that we don’t always defer to the paths that have been set out for us. Sometimes these desire paths unwittingly trample on sensitive vegetation or cause other environmental fractures. But other times they are used by city or park planners to design traffic flows and the spaces around them. When designers and planners don’t take our idea to minimize energy expenditure into account, we end up with spaces that impede our movement and which people must use in a different way.

Humans, like every other species, are energy minimizers—intensely so. Our brain has developed as an energy minimizer, as have the rest of our body parts. Psychologists have a word for the efficiency mechanism in how we think: heuristics.

Heuristics are shortcuts and thus require us to expend less energy. The results may not always be the best that could have been (they usually aren’t), but they are often good enough for whatever situation we are in. In a process known as **“satisficing,” we’ll often search for the first thing** in our brain that satisfies our minimum acceptable conditions. This saves time and energy, but it doesn’t mean we get the best outcome. ^9fbba3

Heuristics are more likely to be accurate in situations with a stable environment, frequent exposure (large sample size), and immediate, unambiguous feedback. In his studies of firefighters, for example, Gary Klein demonstrates the accuracy of the quick decisions that firefighters make in the course of their jobs, and how this accuracy increases over time. 2 Why? **Fires are governed by rules of chemistry and physics, and thus exhibit consistent behaviors.** The more you interact with fires the more you will build knowledge that allows you to intuitively make good decisions in future fire situations.

The more unreliable the previous experience, such as by being too complex to identify true cause and effect or being based on too small a sample size, the more likely your heuristics aren’t going to be particularly useful. **Clinical therapy has this problem.** The nature of the situation makes it hard to receive immediate feedback on if the therapy is actually working. There could be a host of other factors that contribute

Other heuristics seem to be built into how our brains operate. The most famous of these—**anchoring, availability, and representativeness**—were extensively studied by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. ^ac3136

**Always go back to the base rates** and then ask if this new information you have could affect those rates substantially enough for you to change your guess. Without this vigilance, the availability of the news stories or the anchor of the word cocoa would likely prompt you to choose chocolate when asked to

Sometimes our tendency to conserve energy helps us, and sometimes it hurts us. While minimizing our output ensures we will have extra to draw on in times of increased need, it can also get in the way of learning. **Experience doesn’t become learning without reflection, and reflection is an energy expenditure.** If we want to develop our thinking and get the most out of our environments, then we have to be aware of the natural tendency to minimize energy output and correct for it where doing so creates value.
