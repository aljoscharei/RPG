The answer seems obvious — we should rely on conscious thought . That’s what a team of Dutch researchers led by Ap Dijksterhuis found when they asked subjects to make simple choices , such as selecting towels or oven mitts ( Dijksterhuis et al . 2006 ) . But when the researchers turned to complex8 choices , such as selecting an automobile or an apartment , the subjects did better with unconscious thought . In one study , participants read about four apartments that differed in desirability , then either chose immediately , chose after thinking hard about the alternatives , or chose after being distracted for the same period of time . This last group , the unconscious thinkers , made the best choices , picking the apartments that got the highest ratings from judges . In another study , participants tried to select a car from among four different models . 9 The option that was considered the best was the one with the highest proportion of positive features . In the simple condition the participants had to consider only four attributes of the cars ; in the complex condition they had to consider twelve attributes . Some of the participants had a chance to think deliberately about the options for four minutes ; others were distracted by another task for four minutes . Then they made their choice . The conscious thinkers made the right choice in the simple condition ( only four attributes to think about ) but not in the complex conditions . The people who were distracted — the unconscious thinkers — made the best choice in both the simple and the complex conditions .

We can’t easily explain these findings away , because other researchers , including Timothy Wilson , Jonathan Schooler , and John Bargh , have all reported the same results — that conscious deliberation seems to make people less satisfied with their decisions . 11 Conscious thought doesn’t necessarily help us make better choices . Any systematic strategy exposes us to the risks of overthinking . 12 Radiologists worry about overthinking . If they look at a film too long , they start seeing things that aren’t there . After about 38 seconds , they begin to overreact to slight irregularities in normal structures and identify non - existent malformations . 13 What causes overthinking ? One possibility is that we can think of only a few things at a time , so our cognitive bandwidth prevents us from considering all the variables when making choices . Unconscious thought lets us integrate lots of information . Another possibility is that when we consciously deliberate we may over - emphasize some of the features — the features that are easier to verbalize . We may ignore or downplay important features that don’t have convenient verbal tags . Conscious deliberation seems to impose serious penalties on us . Conscious deliberation presses us to view the world through a keyhole — the limitation of attention . And what gets missed by this keyhole view ? Often we fail to notice the context . We happily flag three or four variables and think systematically about these , ignoring the background of what is going on . But when we tell stories , we tend to capture much of the context — that’s the whole idea of a story , to embed facts within contexts . If we try to think about facts without the story ( the context ) , we risk overthinking . It is very easy to miss what is really going on by attending just to the facts . Example 5.5 shows that the objective data may give us a distorted picture of what is really going on .
