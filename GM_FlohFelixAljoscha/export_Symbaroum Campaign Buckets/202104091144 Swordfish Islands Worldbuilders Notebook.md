These instructions were created for Adobe Acrobat. There are many other pdf printing programs, and although their printing interfaces are different, similar options should exist. If you run into any trouble, please hit me up at [support@swordfishislands.com](mailto:support@swordfishislands.com).

1\. Download the file
2\. If you're in North America you'll want to use the "Half Letter" files. If you use International paper sizes, you'll want to use the "A5" files.
3\. Open the pdf of the zine you'd like to make (dot grid, hex grids, isometric, and reference).
4\. Open the print menu (in Acrobat Ctrl+P)

The zines as shown use heavy cardstock for the cover. Accomplishing this will be a two step process. You'll need to print the "guts" of the zine on regular paper, and the cover on cardstock.

+==========================================================+

+==========================================================+

5\. Under "Pages to Print" choose "Pages" and input the following page numbers:
    A. Dot Grids: 3-32
    B. Hex Grids: 3-32
    C. Isometric: 3-32
    D: Reference: 3-36
6\. Under "Page Size & Handling" choose "Booklet"
7\. Ensure that the "Booklet Subset" is set to "Both Sides" and Binding" is set to "Left"
8\. All other settings should be good to go by default, but you can check out the attached image "Guts Print Settings" just in case.
9\. Hit Print

Printing the cover is nearly identical to printing the "guts"

10\. Tell your printer you're using cardstock. This will be different for each printer but click on "Properties" in the Acrobat Print menu and look for "paper type" settings. You should be able to select the appropriate paper weight. If you've just grabbed a piece of cardstock that's lying around and aren't sure of its paper weight, you'll probably be fine if you select a "Mid Weight" type option in the 96-110 gsm range. If you don't set anything the cover will still probably print just fine. However the print quality may not be as good (If you're using a toner printer the logo may flake because the printer didn't get it hot enough), or it may increase the chance of a paper jam, but hey, it's a print-it-yourself zine, there's no wrong way to do it really.

11\. Under "Pages to Print" choose "Pages" and input: 1
12\. Under "Page Size & Handling" choose "Booklet"
13\. All other settings should be good to go by default, but you can check out the attached image "Cover Print Settings" just in case.
14\. Hit Print
