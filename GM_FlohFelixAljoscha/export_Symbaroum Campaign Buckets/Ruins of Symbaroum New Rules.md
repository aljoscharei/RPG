the pLayers anD the Gamemaster have an equal responsi- bility for the shared experience, even if their roles are a bit different when playing. Below you will find suggestions re- garding what aspects of the game session the players should take the main responsibility for. It is entirely up to you and your group if you wish to deviate from what is said below, in which case the suggestions may serve as a guideline for your discussions and decisions.

creatinG characters

The number of players in a gaming group preferably ranges between two and four, though it is fully possi- ble to play with only one player and a Gamemaster. The number of players aside, each player is in control of one character through which they experience and interact with the game world.

Before you create your character it might be a good idea to ask the Gamemaster about the upcoming adventure or the campaign: what kind of character would be appropriate to play? You should also talk with the other players in the group. What are they playing and in what way can the characters complement each other?

the character’s GoaL

Establish at least one distinct goal for your character – some- thing that he or she wants to achieve, defend or avoid. The goal(s) will change over time as the character evolves but there should always be at least one clear goal that helps in propelling the game forward.

As a guideline, it can be said that some goals are inappro- priate for characters and gaming groups. Goals that are an in- evitable effect of playing and therefore lack dramatic potential fall into this category – for instance, “to get better equipment”,

“to get more money”, “to gain more Experience Points” and “to have more and better abilities”. You will find examples of more suitable goals in the box The Character’s Goal below.

the Group’s GoaL

It is good for the group to share a common goal besides the characters’ personal ones. Discuss with the other players what your group would like to accomplish, in the short or

    BrinG the character to Life
    
    Describe your character to the group so that everybody gets a sense of who he or she is. Play and act as if you were there, experiencing it all, and trying to achieve the character’s goals. When things happen, react to them. Describe what your character wants to do and the Gamemaster will explain what is needed for that to succeed.
    
    initiate scenes
    
    You should not be afraid to initiate things, to let your char- acter respond to and interact with the game world. Describe your intentions and the Gamemaster will decide what you need to do in order to make it happen. Sometimes the
    

Gamemaster will turn your initiative into a challenge, for you or for the entire group.

DeveLop your character

Allow your character to change as an effect of what he or she experiences and what happens in the game world – just as Frodo and Bilbo are changed by their adventures. Depend- ing on what he or she has to suffer through, it is possible for a character to change anything from beliefs and goals to their appearance and the focus of their abilities. As you gain levels, you might choose features that correspond to what challenges you have faced, or acquire new abilities that mirror the character’s hard-earned experiences.

DescriBe future pLans

When a game session ends, describe what your character intends to do next, so the Gamemaster can prepare for it. Should the session instead mark the end of an entire ad- venture, describe what your player character will do until the start of the next adventure.




The Role of the Gamemaster

The Gamemaster is the person who holds the game together, mainly by presenting the setting of Sym- baroum to the players and having their characters face all sorts of dangers and challenges. The Game- master should take some time to learn the content of the Player’s Guide as well, since they may guide new players through the process of character creation, and teach them how to use the rules of the game. Furthermore, the Gamemaster is meant to manage the characters’ opponents – enemies and monsters that are provided in adventures or in the Bestiary. More guidelines for the Gamemaster can be found in the Ruins of Symbaroum Gamemaster’s Guide




Traveling

traveLs in aMBria are extended affairs through mo- notonous open farmlands, while traveling in Davokar offers more excitement than most can endure – at least if you are lacking experience and fail to read the signs of danger in time. The following section offers a description of the three different types of terrain presented in the table below.


forceD Marches anD riDes

A forced march consists of an accelerated pace for an excep- tionally long time – instead of spending 8–10 hours traveling at a reasonable pace, a forced march or ride might require the characters or mounts to travel from first light to com- plete darkness at a quick pace. During forced marches you cannot take long rests.

If the forced march continues for a number of days be- yond your Constitution modifier then you must make a Constitution saving throw each evening with a DC equal to 5 + the number of days force marched so far. On a failure you gain a level of exhaustion. If it is a forced ride then your mount’s Constitution modifier is used and they must make the saving throw instead.

Death Marches anD riDes

This type of travel takes no consideration for the needs of the travelers and is continuously brutal and demanding. You cannot take long rests when traveling this way. If the death march continues for a number of days beyond your Con- stitution modifier, you must make a death saving throw at the end of each day after that. If you fail three death saving throws, you collapse and die from the strain of the march. When you do take a long rest you can erase one failed death save for each long rest.


Rests

heroic thouGh they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social in- teraction, and combat. They need rest – time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

In Ruins of Symbaroum there are three different kinds of rest that the characters can take.

short rest

Short rests require one hour of light effort, no more than sitting and talking, tending to wounds and the like. You gain the following benefits when you complete a short rest:  
• You can spend one or more Hit Dice to recover hit points,

up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to your level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. You regain spent Hit Dice upon finishing an extended rest, as explained below.

• You reduce your temporary Corruption by your profi- ciency bonus.

• You can spend a Hit Die in order to reduce your tempo- rary Corruption by your proficiency bonus again. You can continue to do this as long as you have Hit Dice to spend and temporary Corruption to reduce.



example: Grumpa the Ogre is 3rd level and thus has 3 Hit Dice. She has a Constitution of 16 (+3). During a short rest, she decides to use one Hit Die for healing and recovers 6 (3 on the 1d8, + 3 for Constitution) hit points. Feeling like the roll was a bit low, she decides to use a second Hit Die and this time gains another 8 (5 on the 1d8, +3 for Constitution) hit points. The total amount healed is 14 (6 for the first roll pus 8 for the second) hit points. She reduces her temporary Corruption by 2 (her proficiency bonus) and, since she is a Mystic, decides to spend her last Hit Die to reduce her tem- porary Corruption by a further 2 points.

LonG rest

A long rest requires around eight hours, six of which must be spent sleeping and the other two in light activity, such as being on watch, reading, or conversing with others. You gain the following benefits when you complete a long rest: • You recover hit points equal to the maximum value of

your Hit Die (e.g. 8 for 1d8) plus your Constitution mod-

ifier. This does not count as using a Hit Die.  
• You reduce your temporary Corruption by twice your

proficiency bonus.  
• YoucanspendoneormoreHitDicetorecoverhitpoints,

up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to your level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier



to it. You regain hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. You regain spent Hit Dice upon finishing an extended rest, as explained below.

• You can spend a Hit Die in order to reduce your tempo- rary Corruption by your proficiency bonus again. You can continue to do this as long as you have Hit Dice to spend and temporary Corruption to reduce.

example: Agneisha completes a long rest. The human staff mage recovers 10 hit points (8 for the 1d8 Hit Die, +2 for Constitution modifier). She also reduces her temporary Cor- ruption by 6 (twice her proficiency bonus of +3). She chooses to spend a Hit Die to heal 7 more hit points and one more Hit Die to reduce her temporary Corruption by 3 again.

extenDeD rest

An extended rest requires at least 24 hours in a safe place where you can sleep, relax and tend to your wounds with- out threat of interruption. Extended rests often mark the end of an adventure, or at least a significant break in the action. You gain the following benefits at the end of an extendedrest:

• You regain all of your hit points.  
• You recover all of your Hit Dice.  
• Your temporary Corruption becomes 0.



Social Challenges

sociaL chaLLenGes are problems and situations where the players will have to roleplay their way out of trouble; tactics and just rolling dice is not enough. Sure, a social chal- lenge is often preceded by problem-solving or even combat, but during the challenge itself the players, portraying their characters, must convince someone or some faction to do as the player characters want.

appropriate sociaL chaLLenGes

It requires more than just a couple of Charisma (Persuasion) checks to have an exciting scene of social conflict. It will feel more rewarding if the players roleplay out the bulk of the scene, using dice and ability checks only to establish the initial scene and to finalize the solution once the heroes propose a compromise.

A scene where a powerful person, creature or group must be convinced makes for an interesting social challenge. Meetings with less important persons can also be made into social challenges, if the outcome of the scene (profit from success, cost from failure) is of enough importance to the player characters.

Another option is to use the social challenge as the last step in an extended problem: the characters must bribe, con- vince and trick a number of administrators, advisors and guards in order to get an audience with one of the Queen’s dukes. This requires a series of ability checks, just like in an extended problem-solving situation. The game then turns into a social challenge when the characters finally stand in front of the duke or duchess.

the GaMeMaster’s roLe

In social challenges, the Gamemaster must decide what is at stake for the target of the player characters: what does the target have to win from doing as the player characters


suggest? What does the target have to lose? What is the pos- sible cost of deciding to do something else? For a situation to be a social challenge there has to be a real possibility for both success and failure on the player characters’ part, even if the odds may lean one way or the other.

the sociaL chaLLenGe

Most social challenges consist of three elements: the intro- duction, discussion, and evaluation.

Introduction

In order to have a meaningful meeting, the party’s subject needs to know who they are and why their opinions, ques- tions or requests should be honored. For some non-player characters well-acquainted with the characters this might be automatic, for others this will require a group check, using the appropriate skills – usually Charisma (Persua- sion), but some characters might use Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Deception, Intimidation or Performance) in- stead. Some groups might propose a single spokesperson instead, the chart below gives results for a single roll in parentheses. The Gamemaster sets the DC depending on the subject’s reaction to the meeting (DC 10 – indifferent, DC 15 – reluctant, DC 20 – opposed). The following outcomes are possible:

• Almost all succeed (success by 5 or more). The subject is convinced that this meeting is important. Unless the discussion changes their mind, the group has advantage on the evaluation roll.

• More than half succeed (basic success). The subject is willing to conduct the meeting. The group might earn advantage or disadvantage during the discussion but currently has neither.

• At least some succeed (basic failure). The subject al- lows the meeting, but is predisposed against the group. Unless the discussion changes their mind, the group has disadvantage on the evaluation roll.

• All fail (failure by 5 or more). The subject refuses the meeting. The group cannot try again until something significant changes.

Discussion

Now the talk turns to specifics – what do the characters want? What can they offer? The player characters, the sub- ject, and other non-player characters discuss the issue. The GM keeps a mental tally during the discussion – if most of the proposals are reasonable and account for the subject’s opinions, powers, and feelings then the group might earn advantage on the evaluation roll. The reverse is also true if the characters are arrogant, obstinate or poorly prepared. Advantage here cancels out disadvantage on the introduc- tion and disadvantage cancels out advantage as well.






Evaluation

Once the discussion reaches a decision point, one charac- ter in the group makes another check against the same DC used for the introduction. This indicates the final result of the meeting:

• Success by 5 or more. The subject agrees completely with the group and does whatever they can to support them. This may include reaching out to others in posi- tions of power.


-   egular success. The subject is willing to help the group but has limitations on what they can offer. However, the primary objective of the characters is met.
    
-   Regular failure. The subject is unwilling or unable to help the group in any significant way. However, they might offer a minor concession to avoid future



awkwardness (for example perhaps they can’t offer any of their warriors but can provide enough shillings that the group could hire some mercenaries for a short time.)

• Failureby5ormore.Themeetingbreaksdownentirely, perhaps the character misread the situation or the sub- ject is completely unable or unwilling to aid the group. Their only hope is to leave quickly and trust that the sub- ject has a short memory.

experience

If the challenge is of enough importance – if it greatly affects the player characters’ chances to achieve their goal by either success or failure – then they should receive an XP award for the social challenge, probably about 100 × their current level for success or half of that on a failure.

# Corruption

0.  in Ruins of symbaRoum magic has a real and immediate price. Every creature has a shadow, an ethereal reflection of themselves. For most normal people, their shadow turns gray as their life, with its disappointments, turnings and sorrows, passes. But for those who wield magic or delve into the most dangerous places of sorrow and memory, the deadly darkness of true deep shadow awaits. The darkness can overcome you, driving you to madness and despair. But it is also the only path to power. What will you dare?
    
    shaDow
    
    Each living creature possesses a Shadow, an aura around them that can be seen by those with the talent to perceive such things. In the world of Symbaroum, no one possesses a singularly bright-white Shadow, instead most folk have a shifting pattern of muted colors and grayness, representing a hard life full of sacrifices and suffering. Those who would brave the forest of Davokar or serve the Queen boldly might have brighter, more vibrant and more complex Shadows, but for those heroes who choose to fight against the evil nature of the world, gaining Corruption is inevitable. As Corruption in- creases, a Shadow becomes darker, more twisted and tainted.
    
    Natural beasts have green, red and white shadows or sometimes another bright primary color. Civilized creatures have gold, silver, copper or sometimes other metallic shades. Corrupted creatures have dark shadows: blight beasts or nearly-corrupt creatures are black and purple while less blight-stricken beings exhibit a slight change in their colors, like corroded copper, blackened silver, sickly green, red with streaks of rust or white with flakes of ashen gray.
    
    Shadow and Alignment
    
    The underlying theme of Ruins of Symbaroum is the struggle between nature and civilization, between creativity and discipline – and what happens when nature is cultivated


(mainly by humanity); in this fantasy we imagine that nature lashes out in the form of Corruption, blightmarks, abominations and a darkening of the land. It is very much a matter of belief, action and feedback, but less about clear- cut good and evil. We do not think you need alignments to play in this world. You can of course use them, if you want to; it’s not incompatible, just not necessary for the world to make sense.

corruption

Power corrupts, and in Ruins of Symbaroum this is quite lit- erally true. A fundamental principle is that when nature is cultivated or violated it grows dark and vengeful – and strikes back! The darkness that comes alive in this way feeds off and can continue to infect its surroundings. Since Mystics bend and warp nature according to their will, they are constantly threatened by Corruption. This principle is mirrored in the concept of Shadows and in creatures like abominations and the undead.

Corruption starts at 0 and increases from there. Most Corruption gathered is temporary, your character struggles against a dark foe, or uses non-permanent magic and their Shadow temporarily grows darker. However, sometimes you will gain permanent Corruption, usually by taking up a pow- erful magical item or by exceeding your Corruption Threshold.

For non-Mystic characters, your Corruption Threshold is equal to the total of twice your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier, as the influence of a darkening Shadow makes most people gloomy and morose. So the formula is:

Corruption Threshold = ([your proficiency bonus × 2] + your Charisma modifier), minimum 2.

During the course of the game, you will gain temporary Corruption. You might also start with a certain amount of


permanent Corruption, due to your equipment or mishaps in the past. Your starting Corruption value can never be lower than your permanent Corruption score.

If your total Corruption (temporary plus permanent) exceeds your Corruption Threshold, you must make a Corruption check, to see if you can bear so much dark- ness. Roll a d20. If the result is equal to or less than the amount by which your current Corruption exceeds your Threshold, you will gain a mark of Corruption. Roll 1d20 on the Marks of Corruption table to the right. The mark fades 24 hours after your total Corruption drops below your Corruption Threshold.

example: Mira’s ogre mystic Grumpa has been casting sev- eral spells in a desperate bid to escape some unwise hunters. Grumpa’s Corruption Threshold is 7 and Mira’s last casting brings her current Corruption to 10. 10 (current Corruption) minus 7 (Corruption threshold) equals 3. She rolls a d20 and if the result is 3 or lower, Grumpa will gain a mark of Corruption.

You only make a roll when you gain new Corruption and that new Corruption exceeds your Threshold. If you receive the same mark of Corruption twice then it can either intensify or your GM can choose another result for you.

Corruption and Shadow

As you gain Corruption, your Shadow changes. Temporary Corruption darkens the Shadow, muting any color that it once possessed.

The category listing in the table below indicates how the theurgs of Prios would judge a person’s Shadow, based on their holy smoke ritual (see page 195). Permanent Corrup- tion affects it in the following ways:









Time Within the Game

since the aDventures of a roleplaying game take place in our imagination, we need a way to simulate the passing of time, both to know how long different effects are active (such as the effects of elixirs or mystical powers), and to keep track of the movements and actions of individual char- acters. Ruins of Symbaroum uses the following divisions to clarify what is happening.

Standard Terms

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In ruins or other danger- ous environments, an adventurer’s movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the edge of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.

For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Yndaros to Ravenia, the adventurers spend three uneventful days on the move before a wild goblin am- bush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game re- lies on rounds, each encompassing a 6-second span of time.

Scenes

We often refer to scenes, which are comparable to scenes in a movie: one location, a couple of characters and something important that happens (a challenge). A scene usually lasts several minutes, or up to an hour. The duration of many features and spells allows them to persist for an entire scene.

Scenes can be started by both players and the Gamemaster – a GM may introduce the characters to a challenge and the players get a chance for their characters to perform actions which make the game world respond in a challenging way. For a situation to count as a scene, it has to include a challenge

and, hence, an element of risk or cost to the player characters. Successful scenes (even non-combat ones) should contribute towards Experience Points, probably about 100 × the char- acter’s current level for success or half of that on a failure.

Interlude

The interlude is a scene without a challenge. It is often an at- mospheric scene, where the player characters discuss some- thing important or plan for the future. It can also be a briefly described journey. Interludes differ from scenes in that they do not grant Experience Points. The reason for this is that they lack any risk or challenge for the player characters to overcome.

DowntiMe

Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your charac- ter is doing during their downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a cer- tain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the down- time activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented be- low are possible. If you want your character to spend their downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

Crafting

You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equip- ment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations nec- essary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceed- ing 5 thaler, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 thaler, you make progress every day in 5-thaler increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of full plate armor (market value 500 thaler) takes 100 days to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 thaler worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, four characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of full plate armor in 25 days, at a total cost of 250 thaler.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle with- out having to pay your cost per day (see page 176), or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal expense.

Enterprise Management

If you have an enterprise (see page 148), you can check in on it. In addition to withdrawing capital, you also can afford a comfortable lifestyle as long as you are in the same location as your enterprise.

Practicing a Profession

You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a


member of an organization that can provide gainful employ- ment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead. If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put this to use during your down- time, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead


Recuperating

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison. After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Con- stitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:

• Endoneeffectonyouthatpreventsyoufromregaining hit points.

• Forthenext24hours,gainadvantageonsavingthrows against one disease or poison currently affecting you.


Researching

The time between adventures is a great chance to engage in research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.

When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing to- ward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available. For each day of research, you must spend 1 thaler to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.




Training

You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options. First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required. The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 thaler per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool
