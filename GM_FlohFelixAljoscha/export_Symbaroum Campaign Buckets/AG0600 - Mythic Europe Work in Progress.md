## Society
The society of Mythic Europe is based on only a
few, simple institutions utilized in an effort to
maintain social order and peace. Feudalism is one
of the main social orders, though only has limited
application, affecting those of rural existence. Though much of
Mythic Europe is devoted to farm and field, there also arises the city,
where none of the old ways apply, and social power is available to
the person who can seize it, not simply to the person who holds land
Thus, the society of Mythic Europe is in part devoted to age-old
tradition, and in part is in transition. A balance between the two is
what maintains social order.
feudalism
Originating in the reign of Charlemagne, feudalism forms
the basis of Mythic Europe's society. It largely determines the
three classes of folk
noble, clergy, and peasant
and
preserves order where there would otherwise be chaos. With.
out the debt of service owed by a knight to the lord on whose
land he lives, knights would fight among themselves for land
rather than cooperate to manage it. This social order estab-
lished by feudalism also allows Mythic Europeans the oppor
tunity to live their lives in moderate peace, devoting time to
work, courtly grace, and prayer. Make no mistake, though.
Wars are still fought, but more often between whole kingdoms
than baronies or duchies.


VASSALS AND HOMAGE
All nobles, from the youngest knight to king and emperor,
are socially intertwined by mutual vows of support. All nobles,
save kings or emperors who are the highest of knights, are
subordinate to their lords, who in turn grant their lessers land
in return for pledges of loyalty.
The subordinate noble is
known as the vassal, and the master the liege. Ideally a knight
has only one liege, as the need to serve two lords is demanding
at the best of times and treasonous at the worst. However, a
knight can swear simple homage to two or more lords, manag-
ing lands from different barons or counts, but one is the knight's
liege lord, to whom the vassal swears full homage and military
support.
In the vassal-lord relationship the vassal pays homage to
the liege, pledging to be the lord's servant. The vassal swears
oaths of aid and council (military aid and advice), and promises
loyalty. In return the liege gives the vassal a fief, usually a grant
ofland, but sometimes the revenue of a toll bridge or mine. The
liege also swears to protect the vassal, both militarily and in
court, and to be loyal in turn.
Furthermore, an oath of fealty is sworn by the vassal to the
lord, of which a common clause requires that the vassal never
attacks the liege. The oath of fealty may by required by the liege
at any time, usually to reaffirm the vassal's legal obligations to
the lord. A vassal may defy his lord (i.e., renounce his fealty)
if the lord fails to support the vassal, or otherwise breaks the
oath to the vassal. In this situation, if a genuine breach of trust
can be proven, the vassal keeps the fief of land granted by the
former lord. By the same token, a liege can revoke a vassal's land
if the vassal breaks their social contract.
KNIGHTIY HIERARCHY
In most countries there are two orders of nobles: the lower
order, composed of knights who have no subordinates, and the
higher order of titled nobles, including barons and other great
land owners. All members of noble rank, even knights, have the
benefits and protection of low justice, for themselves and their
lands. Low justice is concerned with non-capital crimes (those
not involving the death penalty; those not involving the murder
of a noble, rape of a noble woman, treason, or heresy). Wielders
of low justice may assign punishments up to the maiming of
criminals - cutting off hands and ears, or blinding. Those who
hold the right of low justice may not try other nobles, though,
nor may they try any member of the clergy (who are protected
by canon law). Most knights and lords wield low justice.
High justice is reserved for kings and emperors, though in
some cases great nobles, such as dukes, have the privilege. High
justice deals with capital crimes, and the right to try the crimes
of nobles.
The knight is the lowest member of the nobility, and is
granted by a lord a knight's fee (fief), which is enough land to
support the knight and family. A usual knight's fee is a manor,
consisting of a fortified house and lands farmed by peasants,
serfs, or slaves. The early Frankish custom of dividing a
knight's lands amongst all heirs is passed for the most part.
Now lands normally go to an eldest son or other male relative
(though sometimes they go to wives and eldest daughters). If
a knight dies without heirs, lands are returned to the liege, who
may give them to anyone else.
Aside from lowly knights who form the majority of the
feudal contract, there are also household or bachelor (from "bas
chevalier," or low knight) knights, who live at the court of their
liege, and form the lord's immediate retinue.
A baron is the next step up the ladder of nobility, and the
first rank which truly has a say in the government of the realm.
It is the barons of England who force King John to sign the
Magna Carta, guaranteeing their rights under the law. A baron
normally subinfeudates his holdings, granting knights' fees to
his followers. Most barons have a primary castle which they use
as their residence. Barons are the vassals of counts, dukes and
kings, and comprise the lowest class of the titled nobility.
Counts receive their lands directly from the king or
emperor, as do dukes. Of the two titles, a dukedom is more
prestigious, even though a count may occasionally hold more
lands. Many dukes hold the rights of high and low justice, and
in France and Germany dukes can wield as much power as the
king or emperor, as appropriate.

RESISTANCE TO
FEUDALISM
Though feudalism creates social hierarchy among nobles,
and thereby establishes some social order, not everyone ben-
efits from the system, so there exist opponents to it. The
peasants of Mythic Europe are at the bottom of the feudal social
hierarchy, being owned, used and abused by the nobles of the
land. Peasants, serfs, and slaves are therefore victims of society,
able to eke out a meagre living, but having nothing to show for
their hardship, especially in comparison to the wealth and
comfort of many nobles and clergy.
It comes as no surprise, then, that there are those subver-
sive activists in Mythic Europe who work to subvert the social
order, seeking to achieve rights and freedoms for rural peas-
ants. These activists are often declared outlaws by the nobility,
and are hunted, but are not necessarily criminals. Indeed, their
intentions may be entirely benevolent, and they may sympa-
thize and cooperate with others who exist outside the feudal
order, like the Magi of the Order of Hermes. Working with the
Order, social activists can coerce peasants to leave their lands
to find freedom in the Order's Covenants, and the activists
themselves can find personal freedom acting as Magi's aids and
assistants.
Such fraternization of social outsiders means danger for all
concerned, however, particularly so for the Order of Hermes.
For a Covenant to harbor a rebel against feudalism means to
raise the ire of landlords who find themselves short of laborers.
Cities and Towns
Cities and towns are something of an aberration in the
social world of Mythic Europe. They largely exist outside the
rural order of feudalism and therefore offer rights and freedoms
to their inhabitants that are unheard of elsewhere. Most lords
and landholders therefore resent towns and cities; serfs can
escape to urban centers and achieve independence there, and
urban centers generate their own wealth, putting them beyond
knightly influence. Rising from the feudal order, and acting as
a wrench in the works of that order, towns and cities represent
social change, and hint at a future in which the old wavs are
made obsolete.
THE HISTORY OF THE
CITY
Mythic Europe's towns and cities have their roots in the
cities of Greece and Rome. However, outside the Mediterra-
nean Basin the hundreds of years that have passed since the fall
of Rome have blurred foreign countries' perspective on their
urban heritage. In Italy and Greece, and Spain and the
Byzantine Empire, are cities which can trace their history to
before the birth of Christ. North of the Alps, however, in the

old Roman provinces of Gaul and Britannia, many Roman cities
were abandoned or shrank to mere villages, and forgot their
origins. A few others, like London and Tours, prospered and
became the nuclei for kingdoms, but achieved their own
identity as independent centers, not descendents of Rome.
CITY TRAITS
All towns have some common elements, though certainly
not all can be discussed here.
Generally speaking Mythic
Europe's towns are too large to be self-supporting, so must
trade with the countryside for enough food to feed the masses.
A merchant class is therefore necessary to provide goods and
services, not only to the citizens of the city, but also to the
countryside.
Cities also have certain inherent rights, particularly related
to the freedom of citizens and trade. Indeed, while all cities and
towns enjoy the same rights and guarantees, many share the
same laws and customs as well. A few cities, such as Venice, are
true city-states, free from the power of the nobility, while others
are the personal fief of a noble lord. However, even if the fief
of a lord, cities offer greater freedom and independence than
offered on farm and field.
Although often divested from the feudal nobility, most
cities and towns assume some of the trappings of the nobility,
often to declare their position in society. These towns appoint
themselves coats of arms, and strike seals with which to legalize
documents. Town guilds are also given to ostentatious dis
plays, competing with each other as nobles might in tourna-
ments, but through parades, feasts and civic ceremonies.
The social status of all cities and many towns is also
affirmed by being the seat of a bishopric or archbishopric. In
large cities the Church often builds splendid cathedrals, not
only to give glory to God, but to attract the devout (who spend
their money in the city while visiting the cathedral). By finding
a flock to preach to and earn money from in cities, the Church
lends credibility to those cities, further protecting urban cen-
ters from the pressures and influence of the nobility.
Walls and gates are common to all cities, and are more than
defensive. Walls and gates regulate the flow of traffic into and
out of the city, allowing tolls to be easily collected. And, near
city gates can be found inns and other amenities for travelers.
Roads also lead from gates to squares, which represent the type
of businesses that can be found in those parts of the city. One
square may contain cloth and clothing stores, while another
may be more of an urban administrative center.
Finally, people in all cities tend to live in areas appropriate
to their lifestyles. Most live within walking distance of their
workplace, if not actually inside their place of employment.
And, a city always has a section devoted to foreigners, since the
very existence of the city depends on trade. Some cities,
especially ones with universities or church schools, or ones that
are great trading centers, may have sizable foreign populations.
Offering freedom and independence to their inhabitants,
and being centers for international relations, cities in Mythic
Europe are more receptive to feudal outsiders than are rural

regions. Indeed, peasants who escape from the farm to live in
a city for a year and a day are declared free. Furthermore, cities
are places where the unusual is more readily accepted than it is
in the countryside. Magi of the Order of Hermes can therefore
anticipate a more hospitable response from city-goers than they
can from country folk. However, Magi must keep in mind that
even city folk are close-minded to some degree. Caution is
always suggested no matter where a wizard travels.
Commune
Communes are towns or cities which have become self-
governing, whether by peaceful charter or by military force.
Communes are prevalent where the power of noble families is
weak, especially in Flanders and northern Italy. A number of
attributes are common to all communes, including the freedom
of the citizen, the authority to levy tolls and regulate trade, and
the assumption of all judicial functions.
Guilds
A guild is an association of free folk formed for a specific
purpose, be it to control the production and selling of crafts, or
merely to act as a social club for its members. All guilds share
a number of features, including the swearing of oaths, rituals
and feasts. The earliest guilds consisted of Germanic sacrificial
feasts, which the Church found easier to modify to Christian
precepts than abolish. At religious festivals, especially ones
devoted to a guild's patron saint, guilds try to out-do each other
with the magnificence of their displays. When displays are
being prepared and presented there are even bouts of intra-
guild intrigue and violence.
Typical Mythic European guilds provide most townsfolk
with the only social activity they choose to participate in. Most
members of a guild are likely to work at the same sort of job, live
in the same area, and attend the same church as other guild
members. The oaths a guild member swears and the rituals
performed help strengthen the bond shared between fellow
guild members.
Being closed and often secretive societies, guilds superfi
cially seem akin to Covenants of the Order of Hermes. Both
guilds and Covenants have secret meetings, require vows of
their members, require members to work with and support
each other, and pursue rivalries. To the uninitiated a Covenant
might be mistaken for a guild, or a guild for a Covenant. After
all, who knows what goes on behind closed guild doors. Some
whisper of infernal activities.
MIlLs
Grain must be ground before it is fit to eat. Hand mills
called querns may be used by peasants, but for the most part
grain is milled in large water, wind, or beast-driven mills. A mill
is sure sign of a manor, as large mills are owned almost
exclusively by local lords.


All mills, from the hand held quern to the largest wind mill,
have two parts in common. The first is the platform or stone,
a flat surface upon which grain is placed. The other part is the
millstone, a heavy round stone which rotates above the plat
form. In a quern, the millstone is lifted from a bowl, grain is
poured in, and the millstone is turned by hand. In larger mills,
grain is automatically fed through the millstone.
Querns are small (about a foot across), and require a
tremendous amount of time and energy. Querns are mostly
used for day-to-day milling, to make one loaf of bread, for
instance. In most areas querns are illegal because they take
work away from the local mill. The forecourt of the Bishop of
Lincoln's palace is paved with querns confiscated from the
Bishop's tenants. (Some of the Order of Hermes say the Baron's
bitterness has even infused the querns with Perdo vis).
Animal driven mills are the simplest large-scale mills to
build and operate (most gearing in wind and water mills is
required to change the angle of force, rather than grind grain)
Animal mills usually have one, two, or four animals in harness
The animals walk in a circle around the mill. The animals are
usually entitled to spillage from the mill, which explains the
folk saying, "Do not bind the mouth of the ox that grinds the grain."
Water mills come in two varieties, overshot and under-
shot. The similar names refer to the area of the water wheel
which is hit by rushing water. Overshot wheels are water-fed
from the top. Undershot wheels sit in the stream. Complex
gearing changes the direction of spin, and allows the miller to
stop the mill.
Wind mills were invented in the deserts of Egypt and
Arabia, where water is scarce. They operate under the force of
the wind, and thus require mechanisms to shift the sails to best
catch the wind. The benefit of wind mills is obvious: they may
be used if water is sparse, or if a local stream is not strong
enough to work a water mill
Water and wind power are also harnessed for other pur.
poses, especially the fulling of cloth and the cracking of stones
to get at the metal within. In the latter case, a series of hammers
is activated by a revolving beam, with shims in place to lift the
ends of the hammers. In the city of Graz, watermills power
hammers which pound iron stock, producing sheets of iron for
use in armor (though the odd murder is suspected to have
occurred under the mechanical hammers).
The Count du Coucy has recently granted a monopoly on
milling in his county to the operators of a mill on the banks of
the Seine. The people of Coucy, who had often done their own
milling with querns or animal-driven mills, are being forced to
give up their millstones. This has caused increased unrest in the
area. Even Cathar Believers have joined the side of the peasants,
preaching rejection of the Count's decree. Unrest in the County
may soon attract the attention of the Inquisition, which has
been seeking an excuse to declare the area heretical. Conflict
between locals and Inquisition forces may draw in locale Magi,
as peasants ask local Covenants to intervene on their behalf. Of
course, involvement in mundane affairs is strictly against the
Code of Hermes.

Education
The primary source of education in Mythic Europe is the
Church, which maintains a tradition of literacy and knowledge.
However, independent universities also provide an education
to those who can afford to pay for it. Given to the time and
money involved, only the nobility and wealthy merchants can
afford a university education.
The basic educational curriculum comprises the seven
liberal arts, divided into the basic Trivium (grammar, rhetoric,
and dialectic), and the more advanced Quadrivium (arith-
metic, geometry, astronomy, and music). However, teachers
have great leeway in the subjects they may emphasize or ignore.
Higher education is available from universities and the
Church, and is comprised of the studies of law, medicine and
theology. While it is not impossible to become a master of more
than one subject, it is extremely rare.
Learned in the world and its higher arts, students, profes-
sors, and even scholastic clergy can be more receptive to the
unorthodox than can the common Mythic European. Magi of
the Order of Hermes may therefore seek aid and information
among the educated, and those sought may require esoteric
learning in return for their services. In fact, the open mind of
a young student can make payment possible by indoctrination
into the wizardly ways.


Banking
Arranging loans was once the exclusive domain of Jewish
moneylenders. Christians are forbidden by the Church from
charging interest on loans (charging interest on a loan is called
usury, a sin in the eyes of the Church), and the nobility finds
it beneath their dignity to haggle over rates of exchange and
payment.
However, the growth of international trade creates the
need to move large amounts of money from city to city without
risking capture by brigands and robbers. In addition, rates of
exchange in coin benefit only the coin-changer, who takes from
one twentieth to one tenth of the value of the coins changed
Thus, banks, even Christian ones, have arisen.
A number of Italian families, already rich from trade, now
provide the means whereby money can safely be transported
long distances. They do so by establishing banks. A family
sends a number of its members to a distant city with enough
currency to open a branch of the family bank.
When a
merchant wishes to travel to that city, he gives a sum of money
to the banking house in his home city. The bank then gives him
a letter of credit, good for that same sum (minus fees for
handling) when presented at the office of the bank in the
foreign city. In this way, the traveler need not personally carry
money.
Forging letters of credit is difficult, as banking houses each
use codes to validate their letters. However, each house keeps
spies in the offices of other houses. A clever and lucky house
can bankrupt the competition with a few well placed forgeries.
The Florentine Del Toro family was destroyed in just this
way. The Del Toro was a prosperous house, with banks in
Champagne, Flanders, and England. However, the family's
rival, the De Marco family, managed to place a spy in the Del
Toro home branch (the spy married a Del Toro cousin, and was
offered a business position).
The spy was eventually given charge of delivering the Del
Toro family codes to the outlying branches of the bank. He
somehow copied the codes out of the sealed book in which they
were recorded, and the De Marcos, in a carefully timed strike,
managed to bankrupt each Del Toro branch within a single
week. They sent out several agents with forged letters of credit
to exchange.
When the magnitude of the disaster became apparent the
head of the Del Toros, Enrico, committed suicide by leaping
from the top of his family tower. After the fall of the family,
other banking houses have tightened their security, hiring
guards and even Magi to safeguard their codebooks. Though
little known, an unlucky De Marco agent once opened a spell-
protected codebook, and was blinded by the spell contained in
the volume. Evidence of the spell could mean trouble for the
Magus who cast it, for sign of a Sigil might trace back to the
wizard and incriminate her in mundane affairs.

Coinage
The silver penny, or denarius, is the standard coin of all
Mythic European countries, by whatever name it is known.
The value of the coin is contained in its metal. Thus, coins of
a debased metal are worth less than those of pure silver. Coins
are manufactured at about 240 to the pound. Some countries
produce coins worth half or quarter pennies, but normal
practice is to literally cut a penny in halves or quarters.
Silver is the common metal devoted to coins, though that
silver is often debased by the addition of other metals. Some
gold coins are minted for special occasions, or in countries
familiar with the gold coinage of the Saracens. Indeed, many
cities in Italy have begun minting gold currency since German
Emperor Frederick Il started minting the Augustale in Sicily.
But, gold coins are still rare north of the Alps.
The minting of coins is a lucrative business because of the
opportunity for fraud. By combining a lesser metal, such as
copper, with silver or gold, more coins are produced for the
same weight of silver. Such corrupt coins are said to be made
of "billon." The English Sterling penny is the strongest and least
devalued coin, due to royal control of English mints. Because
of its value, the Sterling is used widely in Flanders, Germany,
Scandinavia, and France. Mints are often given as fiefs to nobles
or towns, with a share of the profits going to the king or a local
noble.
Few know it, but Magi of Hermes pose the greatest threat
to Mythic Europe's coinage system since Magi can use their
magic to fabricate coins. In fact, their coins need not even exist
permanently, disappearing into nothingness a short while after
being passed. Abuse of magic in this way would cause terrible
troubles for the Order, though, as not all Magi can resist torture
and a Magus caught passing bad coins might implicate the
entire Order. To get revenge against the Order for some
punishment, a bitter Magus might also fabricate coins and set
the Order up for cheating "God-fearing" folk.
Recently, coins of values greater than one penny, known
as the Groat or"greater coin, have been struck. The value of the
Groat depends on the devaluation of the penny, so that the
Venetian Grossi is worth 24 denari, and the French Gros
Tournai is worth only 12 denari. However, the French Denari
is worth two of the Venetian. The Groat is usually minted at
about 60 to the pound.
Hanseatic League
The Hanseatic League is a group of cities in northern
Germany which regulate trade on the shores of the Baltic. The
League trades the goods of the north, particularly furs, amber,
wood, and fish, for fabric and manufactured goods from
England, Flanders, and the west. Cologne and Lubeck are the
leaders of the Hanse, and most coastal cities on the shore of the
Balticare members. Inland, Magdeburg and Cologne pass trade
south and west. The members of the League band together and
are able to ignore demands for money from the Emperor, and
even impose their will on countries who refuse to trade with
them.
The Teutonic order is a rival to the League, and several
smaller leagues have formed inland to block the spread of the
League south. The League has no formal membership, with
cities and towns joining and leaving more or less at will.
However, the League is constantly encouraging cities to join, as
the greater an area trading through the League, the greater the
potential profits available to member cities. Though no offers
have yet been made, members of the League have heard of the
Order of Hermes and plan to offer its Magi a place in the League.
Markets and fairs
Markets and fairs are the mercantile gatherings of Mythic
Europe. Throughout the land, farmers and traders gather at
markets and fairs, buying and selling produce, farm goods, and
the occasional city-made item. Along with traveling mer-
chants, markets and fairs attract performing troupes, Pardon
ers, thieves, and Magi.
Markets are generally local, lasting no more than a few
days. Towns are granted the right to host markets by their lord
who takes a percentage of all moneys exchanged. Because a
license is required, most areas have only a few market towns
Markets are usually held in the fall, after the harvest.
Fairs originated as gatherings of local merchants on Church
holidays, when merchants were assured the populace was in
town for services. From these gatherings grew the great fairs,
which attract merchants from all over Mythic Europe. While
fairs of all sizes can be found, the largest are in the County of
Champagne, where the local Count encourages their growth
(for his own profit).
As a rule, the duration of a fair is determined by its size,
with large fairs lasting longer and thereby attracting more
business (and taxes). A small village fair may last one or two
days, while the Champagne Fairs each last seven weeks. Some
fairs attract a specific type of commodity -leather, wine, or
horses, for example - while others offer wares of all kinds.
Many merchants are attracted to the largest fairs while only
tinkers or minor merchants might show up for a local fair.
Merchants from Italy, Spain, England, and Germany gather at
the Champagne Fairs.
Fairs attract many people aside from merchants. Food and
drink vendors circulate amongst the crowd, or hawk their
wares from booths. Traveling players and minstrels entertain
crowds with passion plays, juggling, stilt-walking, fire-eating
and other shows. Cutpurses, whores, and other members of the
criminal class mix with the crowd, looking for easy money
Pardoners offer remission for sins and sell "holy" relics (most
of which are nothing but junk acquired on the road). The local
lord and his family might also visit, and there may even be a
tournament of honor. The bulk of this exotic throng, however,
are peasants who clutch their purses, buy pretty ribbons, or
simply admire the view. On occasion a Magus visits mundane
fairs, in search of an esoteric item important to some strange

experiment or elixir. These unusual attendants are overlooked
if in disguise, but attract much gossip and suspicion if recog-
nized.
Champagne fairs
The fairs in Champagne are the largest marketplaces in
Mythic Europe. Started in the Twelfth Century by the Count
of Champagne, the fairs attract wool merchants from England,
cloth merchants from Flanders, traders in fur and wood from
the Hanseatic League, Italian traders with goods and spices
from the Orient, and Spanish merchants with finely crafted
leather.
It is said that anything is available at the fairs in
Champagne, though some items may be more dear than others,
and some only of value to particular customers.
Six fairs are held each year, two each at Provins and Troyes,
and one each at Lagny and Bar-sur-Aube. Each fair lasts seven
weeks, with the first devoted to arrivals and receiving of
merchandise, and the last to the settling of accounts. Italian
merchant houses have made carrying large sums of money for
fairs unnecessary, with banking houses in each city able to
dispense funds to merchants with accounts.
The authority and prominence of the Champagne Fairs is
such that travelers robbed on their way to a fair may appeal to
the hosting city, which may not only recompense losses, but
also pressure the province where travelers were robbed to

improve patrols. The fairs' chief means of enforcing their
demands is to deny trading rights to merchants from offending
provinces.
Beside the mercantile business of the fairs, other, less open
negotiations take place. Freelance spies and soldiers discreetly
offer their services to the highest bidder, and many secret
assignations are kept here. All the royal houses of Mythic
Europe have their spies, disguised as honest merchants, travel-
ing from fair to fair, sending messages back to their patrons. On
occasion these spies attempt to eliminate their opposite num-
ber, arranging 'accidents' and bandits' on the road or in the
numerous inns.
The real merchants of the Champagne Fairs long ago
figured out who these spies are, and even know a new spy when
an old one is replaced, or no longer attends the fairs. The antics
of spies are watched by merchants with amusement, and
merchants usually manage to make a good profit from spies,
either on betting who will be killed, or by buying the goods a
false merchant carries as his disguise.
Spies know enough not to attempt any overt acts, as they
know not to unduly disrupt the peace of the Champagne Fairs.
If a spy makes a commotion or mockery of a fair, the Count of
Champagne denies the spy's country the right to trade at fairs
in the future.

spies, while the D'Angelo of Pisa are ready to hire soldiers
and go to war, such is the trade damage being caused by the
Urballo wool. Several Magi who have bought Urballo wool
have experienced severe magical shocks, enough to send one
into Twilight
Roads and Bridges
The Romans in ancient times built roads to bind together
their Empire, but with the fall of the Roman Empire the roads
fell into neglect. In some countries, notably Italy and southern
France, roads are maintained, but in others, like Germany,
where the Romans never conquered, roads fade into the
countryside.
With the revival of trade, new roads and bridges have been
built, and trade passes along and over them in a never-ending
stream. Roads and bridges are now the projects of local lords,
who build them as a means to insure the collection of tolls, both
to maintain the roads and to fill the lords' coffers.
While Roman roads were crafted and engineered with care
and covered in stonework, modern roads are often simple
tracks through the land, with brush cleared away from their
sides. In England, the brush is cleared over the length of a
bowshot from the road, so that brigands and thieves cannot
easily waylay travelers. In other countries, where the King's
writ does not run as strong, roads are much more dangerous
When roads met rivers, the Romans built bridges to cross.
Most lords no longer bother with such care, simply routing a
road to a ford, which might or might not be marked with stakes
to indicate deep water. Most bridges built since the fall of the
Roman Empire are of wood, and rot after a few years, requiring
frequent upkeep. Bridges are normally fortified, as they are
often the only crossing on a river for miles in either direction.
Some bridges even have small castles on either bank, and most
have towers built on the bridge itself, with gates which can be
closed.
Bridges are also a source of income; the toll from bridges
can be given as a fief to knights and lords. One bridge can often
serve as a knight's fee, equipping the knight for duty. In
wartime, the knight is expected to stop an invading army, either
by force or by burning the bridge, keeping the enemy from
crossing the river. However, most knights refuse to so endan
ger their livelihood, and often lose their rights to a bridge when
a lord learns of such dereliction of duty.
Special Messengers
The need to send messages from city to city extends
through the upper levels of society, from kings, popes, town
councils, universities and merchant houses. Special messen-
gers are employed for this purpose, with great authority to act
in the name of their principal.
Messengers are usually mounted, but except for the deliv-
ery of urgent messages, travel no faster than a walk, to conserve
their horses. Messengers wear their employer's livery, and

carry a strong leather pouch or satchel embossed or embroi-
dered with their employer's arms. If a messenger's patron is
powerful enough, markings on a pouch can deter would-be
thieves. or attract their attention.
Messengers are often put in charge of delivering money or
persons to a destination. To this end they may hire guards,
wagons, horses, pavilions, and anything else they require for
the trip. A king or other employer may give a messenger money
for the purposes of protection, or may repay a messenger for
expenses. In either case, the messenger often carries large sums
of money at the beginning of a trip. Robbers have been known
to waylay messengers, but can expect the employer's troops to
hunt them down. Robbing, waylaying, or even delaying a royal
messenger can be viewed as treasonous.
The special privileges of messengers are dependent upon
their employer. Royal messengers have the right to requisition
horses to continue their journey in case of accident (though this
right can be revoked if abused). Messengers of less exalted
patrons must make do with what their purse can purchase. The
Pope keeps a stable especially for his messengers, and Papal
messengers receive free lodging (and nursing, if injured) in
ecclesiastical buildings.
Royal messengers often have extraordinary rights in a
king's name. The messenger eats in the king's hall when not on
a mission, and is given one or more suits of clothing (with pairs
of shoes or boots) each year. While on the road, a royal
messenger is given a stipend for food and lodging. Horses may
also be provided by the king, but more often the messenger
owns a horse and is reimbursed for its death or injury. Old
messengers may become horse buyers for a king, may assume
the maintenance of a royal castle, or may oversee the lodging
and ransom of noble prisoners. In any case, retired messengers
who were valuable and loyal early in life are rewarded later in
life. Some are even sent as ambassadors to wizards' Covenants.
Inns
Travelers on the roads of Mythic Europe need places to
stay when overtaken by darkness or weariness. For noble
travelers, accommodation can often be had at castles and
manors, especially if a traveler is related to the local lord or lady.
Vassals have an obligation to provide hospitality for their lord.
The Church provides temporary lodging for travelers, but quite
often the traveler is awakened at midnight for Matins (the
beginning of the day).
For those who do not have noble influence, or do not wish
to stay at a monastery, the need for shelter may be met by the
many inns which dot roads. Inns are usually located in towns
or cities, or at an easy day's journey from the last stop. Inns
provide rooms for the well-to-do, with a bed big enough for four
or five people, or offer accommodation in the common room.
Prices vary depending on how far it is to other accommoda-
tions; the farther away from the city, the higher the price. All
sorts of people may be found at an inn, from honest merchants
and working men, to cutpurses, Pardoners, and outlaws.

The lone country inn can form the seed of a town,
attracting other businesses related to travel, such as a black-
smith or stables. A tavern is often attached to the typical inn,
providing food and drink. Merchants may also set up booths
in the vicinity of such a stopover. Indeed, a church may even
be built nearby, attracting more settlers. Within a decade or
two, a new town may grow up.
"The Templar's Feast," an inn on the road from Dijon to
Toul, is run by Jean-Jacques, a hardworking man. He, his wife,
and three children have made a good living feeding and
housing travelers, often rich merchants on their way from
France to Flanders. Recently, the inn has become the head-
quarters of Eduard le Savage, an outlawed Norman knight. Le
Savage has gathered many vicious soldiers to his side, preying
on travelers within two days travel up and down the road. The
Baron d'Auton recently lost two men in one of Eduard's raids,
and has sworn vengeance on the knight and his men. The
Count of Champagne has warned d'Auton that no harm must
come to the inn or its owners, as the inn is an important stop
for Italian merchants on their way to the fairs of Champagne.
D'Auton is waiting for the opportunity to catch Eduard on the
road, where the inn cannot hamper the Baron's actions.
Ships and Shippins
Given the troubles and time involved with travel overland,
ships provide a secure and more timely method of travel. Many
types of ships exist, mainly distinguished by whether they sail
rivers or seas, and by which seas they frequent. River craft tend
to be of shallow draft, and maneuvered by sails, oars, or poles.
Smaller rivers carry proportionately smaller boats. Many river
craft are simply log rafts which are poled down river and broken
up upon destination
On the Atlantic and Baltic coasts, ships based on Scandina-
van craft dominate, being built for heavy seas. To help facilitate
rough travel oceangoing ships also have a high freeboard to
prevent swamping. The Norse are the best boat builders in
Mythic Europe, capable of building craft supposedly able to sail
across the Atlantic.
Mediterranean craft have a lower freeboard, and are gen-
rally built lighter than Atlantic vessels. Small Mediterranean
ships tend to be of one or two masts, rigged with a lateen sail.
Galleys also continue to be built here, based on models and
theories handed down from the ancient Greeks and Romans.
These ships are powered by slave oarsmen. Because of their low
freeboard and construction, galleys cannot stand up to the
waves of the Atlantic.
Ships depend on the skill of their navigators to make
landfall. Navigators use a variety of instruments, as well as their
own skill and experience to guide their way. The Vikings used
a lodestone and sunstone to determine their location on the
ocean, but now there exists the compass, which always points
north. Astrology has also lent its wisdom and the astrolabe to
the mariner, allowing a navigator to determine latitude. There
is no way, however, to determine distances east or west when
beyond sight ofland. Even the poorest navigator knows dozens


of landmarks, because a bad sighting can doom an entire crew
to a watery grave. Normal custom is to sail within sight of land
for as much of a journey as possible, to insure the ship stays on
course. During storms, however, prudent mariners sail out to
sea rather than risk being caught between storm and shore.
Due to the uncertain nature of weather, no mariner can
accurately tell how long a trip may last, but a reasonably
accurate guess can be made based on the season. For instance,
the simple journey from Dover to Calais, a mere 19 miles, might
take a few hours with a good wind, or might involve a wait of
several weeks for a wind change. However, an experienced
mariner can tell the best time to make the crossing, as winds
tend to come from a certain direction in specific parts of the
year.
In battle, ships become veritable arsenals, particularly
warships. Raised platforms called castles are built onto the bow
and stern of some ships to provide positions from which
archers may fire. Even trading vessels sometimes have these
castles, as piracy is always a threat. Normal naval tactics call for
ships to approach each other, crews firing bows, until other
crewmen can grapple the other ship and board, sweeping the
opposing deck of the enemy.
In their sea battles the Byzantines use a magical mixture
called Greek Fire, which when lit cannot be extinguished by
water. They place pumps on the decks of their galleys, and
pump the Greek Fire onto the water. They then retreat and fire
the mixture, to torch, redirect, or trap their opponents. The
formula for Greek Fire is known only by a select few craftsmen
in Constantinople, and they are forbidden to leave the city for
any reason. The cities of Italy, especially Venice and Genoa,
offer to make a prince of the person who gives them the secret
of Greek Fire.
TIme Keepins
The keeping of time, both during the day and during the
year, is of great importance to the Church, which must calcu-
late when prayers are said, devotions made, and festivals staged
The historians and clerks of Mythic Europe's kings and emper.
ors must also record when battles, marriages, and decrees
occur. And, the farmer needs to know when to plant and reap
All involve keeping some record of time.

YEARS
Annual time is kept by means of calendars. The system
largely in use in the west is that which Julius Caesar invented
It divides the year into twelve months, and each month into a
varying number of days (though some months lost days due to
political machinations of the Roman senate). Caesar's calendar
was altered by Constantine who divided the months into seven
day weeks (an inheritance from the Jewish Sabbath, allowing
rest on the seventh day).
Major events on the calendar (e.g., saints' days, Easter, and
Christmas) act as reference points for the year, just as a king's
reign is often used as a reference when referring to a year. The
most famous king is, of course, Jesus Christ, and the Church
dates years from the birth of Christ, Anno Domini (meaning
"Year of our Lord"). However, clerks and chroniclers use the
years of more mundane kings' reigns to mark dates (e.g., "In the
seventh year of the reign of Richard, King of England, Duke of
Normandy, Count of Anjou.")
Magi of the Order of Hermes need to keep track of the
passing year, and must mark days during it, to forecast special
events and phases. If vis only appears on a single night of the
year on a faerie mound, Magi need to know of the night's
approach to harvest the vis. Passage of annual time also allows
Magi to recognize potentially dangerous days, when Faerie,
Infernal, or Divine power is particularly powerful.
The year starts on January l, though the names of the
months inherited from the Romans indicate that the year used
to start in March. The change occurred in the Sixth Century
and is the result of starting the year of Grace, year one, at
Christmas. However, there are many other ways to calculate
the start of the year, including Lady Day (March 25), or Easter
(calculated from the time of the Vernal Equinox). Civil
authorities also have their own methods of determining the
beginning and duration of the year (for tax collection pur.
poses). For example, the year of the English Exchequer runs
from Michaelmas to Michaelmas (September 29).


DAYS
The counting of hours is of primary importance to monks
in particular and churchmen in general, who must attend
prayer at specified times during the day. The day, from sunrise
to sunset, is divided into twelve hours, regardless of season, so
that an hour in the winter is shorter than one in the summer.
Indeed, prayers and offices change their hour depending on the
season.
The day starts at Mattins (midnight), followed by Lauds
(soon after Mattins), and then by Prime at daybreak in winter,
or sunrise in summer. After Prime the day is divided into three
hour units, with prayers at Terce, Sext (mid-day), Nones,
Vespers, and Compline (sunset). At each interval, masses,
lessons, or prayers are held. The seasonal hours change at Holy
Cross day (September 14) and Easter.
The need to calculate time has led enterprising monks to
invent ways to signal hours, from waterclocks to mechanical
clocks which ring chimes to awaken the brothers. For travel-
ing, portable sundials can be carried, with holes for the various
months, into which the traveler inserts a peg and then orients
to the north. However, these time pieces are difficult to use
accurately as true north must be known.
The counting of hours in a day is also important to Magi,
especially those involved in laboratory experimentation. If an
experiment reaches a crucial phase at a particular time, a Magus
needs to be able to measure the arrival of that time for the
experiment to be a success. Otherwise, important time, effort,
and, worst of all, vis could be lost.
Like enterprising monks, Magi also create clever devices
for the telling of time. However, where monks' devices are
based on mechanical parts, those of Magi can range into the
supernatural. Woe to any Magus who's magic is interfered with
by powers beyond his control. Prankish faeries and demons are
particularly fond of interfering with the supernatural mechan-
is of Magi's time pieces.
Weights and
Measures
Though no two countries ostensibly use the same system
for weight, length, or volume, most measurements are based on
natural things, whether body parts or grains, and are therefore
of similar determination.
The inch is based on the width of the human thumb, and
so we find lengths of similar size called the thumb in England,
or the tomme in Scotland. The foot is twelve inches long. The
ell, a measure of cloth, is two feet. The yard is measured as three
feet, but according to legend, was introduced by King Henry I


of England and is the length from his nose to his outstretched
hand. The fathom is six feet or two yards, the length of a man's
arms outstretched. The perch, named for the wooden pole with
which it is measured, is about 16 1/2 feet long, and is used for
measuring land. The furlong, or furrow's length, is 400
perches. The mile is 8 furlongs; the word itself comes to from
the Latin Miles Pasuum, or 1000 paces. The league is the length
a man can walk without resting, and measures 3 miles.
Large areas are measured according to the amount a man
can plow in a morning (so are named the German morgen and
English acre), or by how much land a specified amount of seed
can cover (so is named the French setier). Because most fields
are irregularly shaped, the amount of land covered by these
measures is highly variable, being larger in clear land, and
smaller in forests or rough terrain.
Weights are relatively easy to ascertain, as a balance is such
asimple instrument of measurement. Grains of wheat or barley
are often the smallest unit of weight, though the ancients used
the carat, which is now set to be 3 barleycorns or 4 wheat grains.
The ounce dates back to the Romans, and weighs about fifteen
carats, though the English use the Troy ounce of about 16
carats. The mark originated in Germany, and weighs 8 ounces.
The pound is often measured at 16 ounces, or a doublemark.
Larger measures are most often specific for the material being
weighed, but the hundredweight, or 100 pounds, is a common
unit. Fractions or multiples of the hundredweight are com-
mon.
Volume is most often measured from weight. The pint is
the basic unit, and a pint of water weighs a pound. Multiples
of the pint are the quart (2 pints), gallon (8 pints), peck (2
gallons), and bushel (8 gallons). The peck and bushel are
normally used for grain and other dry measure. Greater liquid
measures include the hogshead (63 Gallons), the pipe (126
gallons), and the tun (252 gallons). The tun is used as a
standard measure for the capacity of ships; each ship is said to
be able to carry so many tuns, also known as the ship's tonnage.
Most countries have laws forbidding millers, grocers, or
other merchants from giving short measure, so quite often a
merchant errs on the side of the greater amount. From this
custom comes the "Baker's Dozen," or thirteen of an item.
Measurement of grain and flour often causes the greatest
dispute, as they can be given in "heaped" or "straked" measure,
either of which can vary weight by as much as a sixth of the
whole.
On occasion a Magus's experiments rely on the purchase
of ingredients from mundane merchants. Such Magi are
advised to be careful about the weight of ingredients sold to
them. When taken at a dealer's word, a weight which is false
can lead to disaster for a Magus's experiment, and maybe
Covenant if the experiment involves other dangerous ele-
ments.

## the church
The Church, that of Christianity, is one of the
very foundations of Mythic Europe. Though
internally divested and divided into individual
parts with varying perspectives on God and
the Scriptures, the Church is the unifying force of most Mythic
European people and kingdoms. Indeed, the influence of the
Church exceeds every political boundary and language barrier,
making everyone from king to serf answerable to God, or his
representative in the mortal realm, the Pope.
Of course, the Church is not the only religious institution
of Mythic Europe. Different cultures have their own faiths,
including those of the Jews, Muslims, and the few descendants
of the ancient barbarians who still hold onto their pagan
heritage. However, these faiths are barely tolerated or are
treated with outright hostility-
- branded heretical -by many
followers of the Church. Only the more enlightened followers
of the Church understand that different faiths have different
truths to teach. Many such minds can be found in the Order of
Hermes.
Christianity
Christianity, the principal faith of Mythic Europe, relies on
the belief that the one God exists in three beings: the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit.
The faith also claims that the
redemption of the world is brought about by the incarnation,
passion, and resurrection of Christ, the Son.


The Roman Empire first ignored, then persecuted, then
accepted the faith of Christ. Emperor Constantine accepted the
Christian faith and issued the Edict of Toleration in A.D. 312,
and the Emperor Theodosius outlawed all other religions in
395. After Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire,
missionaries carried the teachings of Christ to people outside
the Empire.
The Muslims overran Christian lands during the Seventh
and Eighth Centuries, capturing three of the original five
patriarchal cities.
The two remaining cities, Rome and
Constantinople, split over the leadership of the Church, with
two major schisms, one in 837 and one in 1054. The Christian
Church healed from the schism of 837, but in 1054 the Pope
and the Patriarch of Constantinople excommunicated each
other, and the two have been separate ever since.
Orthodoxy of faith in the Christian Church is assured with
the requirement that bishops be ordained in the presence of at
least three other bishops of proven orthodoxy. Bishops may
also ordain priests, who maintain the faith of the laity.
The Christian Church even has its own law, which covers
cases of sin (as opposed to crime, cases of which are tried by
mundane courts), and all cases concerning churches and
clergy. Marriage, inheritance, and legitimacy are covered
under Christian law, as are special protections for widows,
orphans, and refugees. Canon law is binding on all baptized
persons, from the lowliest serf to king and emperor.

CATHOLIC CHURCH
The Catholic Church is the great religious organization of
western Mythic Europe, holding sway from Ireland to Hungary
and from Denmark to the southern tip of Italy. The Catholic
Church and the eastern, or Orthodox, Church irrevocably
parted in A.D. 1054, when the Pope and the Patriarch excom-
municated each other.
The head of the Catholic Church is the Bishop of Rome,
known as the Pope. Under the Pope the Catholic Church
divides its lands into provinces, overseen by archbishops, and
further into dioceses, ruled by bishops. Bishops and archbish-
ops rule from cathedrals (from the Latin "cathedra," meaning
seat), which are generally found in cities.
Beneath bishops are individual parishes, each with its own
church. The parish is managed by a rector. If the rector is not
a resident of the parish, as is quite common, a local vicar is put
in charge of the local by the bishop. Rectors and vicars hold
their offices until death, retirement, or promotion, and though
they can be removed for misconduct, they rarely are.
"Regular" clergy are members of orders, such as the
Dominicans or Knights Templar, who live under rules imposed
by the heads of their orders. The head of an order is only
beholden to the Pope, and does not answer to the lesser
authority of archbishop or king. Most regular clergy may hold

or use communal property, but individually are sworn to vows
of poverty. Members of an order may become bishops, but
cannot become parish priests.
The "secular" clergy, those who tend the common folk, do
not belong to orders, but have the task of the saving of the souls
of the populace. They are appointed as parish priests under a
rector, and may advance to any position in the Catholic Church
hierarchy.
Just as the secular world is divided into nobility and
peasants, so too is the Catholic Church. The bulk of clergy
occupy low positions in the Church, and are genuinely con-
cerned with the spiritual health of their parish or community.
However, the higher offices of the Catholic Church are prizes
normally given only to favorites of a bishop or the Pope. Some
bishoprics have large incomes associated with them, and it is
common for a priest to be given the proceeds of a parish or
diocese without having to travel to it. The heads of religious
orders also have many opportunities for embezzlement and
corruption, as they control lands and moneys donated to the
orders by penitent nobles.
Members of the clergy are not subject to the authority of
temporal rulers, only to church law. A member of the clergy
accused of crimes must be brought before superiors in the
Church, who decide guilt or innocence according to canon law.
All members of the clergy are sworn to celibacy, but this
stricture is not always observed.


ORTHODOX CHURCH
The Orthodox Church is the eastern branch of the Chris
tian Church. After the death of Christ and the preaching of his
disciples, five cities became "Apostolic" sees, because their
churches were founded directly by one of the apostles. These
sees were Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome.
Constantinople was added to the list after the Roman capital
moved there. These five cities constituted the leadership of the
Christian Church, but the Bishop of Rome, claiming primacy
because of the succession from St. Peter, rejected the authority
of the other four cities. The fall of Jerusalem, Antioch, and
Alexandria to the Muslim invaders left Constantinople and
Rome as the last two Apostolic sees. The final break between
east and west came in A.D. 1054, when the Pope and the
Patriarch of Constantinople excommunicated each other.
The head of the Orthodox Church is the Byzantine Em-
peror, who represents the whole of the Church. The Emperor
appoints the Patriarch to oversee the business of the Orthodox
Church. All high-ranked clergy are drawn from monasteries,
and must be celibate (though rarely are). Local priests are
chosen by their congregations, and are required to marry.
Priests are presented to the local bishop for ordination.
The Orthodox Church is responsible for the conversion of
the Serbians, Bulgarians, and Russians to the Christian faith.
The faith imparted to these peoples, and that maintained by the
Orthodox Church, involves images, called icons (though a
failed attempt was made to abolish their use in the Ninth
Century). Among these icons is the Blessed Virgin, the special
patroness of the Orthodox faith, and of the city of Constantinople.
pope
When Simon acknowledged Jesus as God's son, Jesus
named him Peter, which means Rock, and said to him, "On this
rock I shall build my church." Jesus also granted Peter the "keys
to the Kingdom of Heaven," and said, "Whatever you shall bind on
Earth will be considered bound in Heaven; whatever you loose on
Earth will be considered loosed in Heaven." After the crucifixion
of Christ, Peter became the head of the Christian Church, and
traveled among the Gentiles preaching the faith. He settled in
Rome, and became its first Bishop. He was crucified by the
Roman Emperor Nero, and buried under what is now the
Cathedral of St. Peter. The Pope, as the Apostolic successor of
St. Peter, holds the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, as head of
the Catholic Church.
The Pope selects the cardinals, who are his chief advisors.
In turn, upon the Pope's death, the cardinals choose his
successor from among their number. The choice of Pope is
often difficult and contentious, as cardinals have their own
agendas and nationalistic sentiments. A poor choice for Pope
is often made as a compromise, particularly when two or more
factions cannot accept each other's candidate. The Roman mob
and the German Emperor are often additional factions whose
wishes cardinals must satisfy in their selection of Pope.

The Cathedral of St. John Lateran is the seat of the Pope,
as the Bishop of Rome. Indeed, the Pope resides in the Lateran
Palace, adjacent to the Cathedral. The office of Pope com-
mands a huge staff, including the College of Cardinals, clergy
for the maintenance of the Cathedral, and clerks to transcribe
letters and Papal Bulls. Noble visitors and even legates from the
eastern Empire can be found waiting for an audience with the
Pope. The Lateran is the center of a maelstrom of politics,
where schemes and intrigue are facts of life. From the choice
of leader for the next Crusade against the Saracens, to the
annulment of a royal marriage, to the ordination of a new
bishop or cardinal, someone on the Pope's staff has an axe to
grind, or a favorite to offer for advancement. Double- and
triple-crosses are common, as staff members try to surpass one
another in the Lateran hierarchy.
The Pope's decrees are called Bulls, from the ribbon which
binds them. Bulls of excommunication or interdict are sealed
with hempen twine, while other Bulls are sealed with silk
ribbon.
TRIALS OF THE PAPACY
Throughout its history the Papacy has faced problems
concerning its leadership of the Christian Church. These trials
have, in one way or another, made the Church and the Papacy
what it is in the Thirteenth Century.
The first trial the Papacy faced was the breakup of the
Christian world into two separate churches, the Catholic and
the Orthodox or eastern Church. The position of the Papacy
has always been that the primacy of the Church rests with the
Successors of Peter, rather than in a council of five Apostolic
sees. The other sees - Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria
and Jerusalem -all lay in what was the eastern Roman Empire.
And, the idea of Apostolic succession, the inheritance of the
sees from the apostles, which forms the very basis of the Papacy,
was contrary to eastern Church thought. Thus, the two camps
had very different perspectives on the structure of the Church
and its faith, leading to their break in A.D. 1054, when Pope Leo
IX and Patriarch Michael Cerularius excommunicated each
other.
The superiority of state over Church has also posed an age-
old threat to the Papacy. The subordination of Church to state
was well advanced by the time of Charlemagne, who merely
treated the Pope as the principal Bishop of the Empire. Further-
more, bishops of the Carolingian Empire collected taxes, acted
as judges, and performed diplomatic missions for the state,
becoming its agents.
Later on Mythic European nobles even appointed bishops
and appropriated Church money for their own use, making the
Church a tool of the laity. This abuse lasted until the election
of Pope Gregory VIl in 1073. Gregory claimed subordination
of Church to state was wrong, and that state should serve
Church. He presented a document called the Donation of
Constantine, which was a grant of Imperial rights designed to
transfer sole control of Italy from Holy Roman Emperor

Constantine to Pope Sylvester I. Pope Gregory also presented
a list of claims about the Papacy, called the Dictatus Papae,
which included the following:
That the Roman church was founded by God alone. That the
Roman pontiff alone can with right be called Universal. That he
alone can depose or reinstate bishops. That, in a council, his legate,
even if a lower grade, is above all bishops, and can pass sentence
of deposition against them. That, among other things, we ought not
to remain in the same house with those excommunicated by him.
That for him alone is it lawful, according to the needs of the time,
to make new laws, to assemble together new congregations, to
make an abbey of a canonry; and, on the other hand, to divide a rich
bishopric and unite the poor ones. That it may be permitted to him
to depose emperors. That he may be permitted to transfer bishops
if need be. That he has power to ordain a clerk of any church he
may wish. That no synod shall be called a general one without his
order. That no chapter and no book shall be considered canonical
without his authority. That a sentence passed by him may be
retracted by no one; and that he himself, alone of all, may retract
it. That he himself may be judged by no one. That no one shall dare
to condemn one who appeals to the apostolic chair. That the Roman
church has never erred; nor will it err to all eternity, the Scripture
bearing witness. That the Roman pontiff, if he have been canoni-
cally ordained, is undoubtedly made a saint by the merits of St.
Peter; St. Ennodius, bishop of Pavia, bearing witness, and many
holy fathers agreeing with him. As is contained in the decrees of St.
Symmachus the pope. That he may depose and reinstate bishops
without assembling a synod. That he who is not at peace with the
Roman church shall not be considered catholic. That he may
absolve subjects from their fealty to wicked men.
These claims, and others, lay at the heart of the investiture
controversy, and were opposed by most kings, especially by
German Emperor Henry IV. Gregory excommunicated Henry,
who retaliated by electing Pope Clement III and declaring
Gregory deposed. The people and nobles of the Holy Roman
Empire voted in favor of Gregory, so Henry, to save his throne,
begged Gregory to lift the ban. Gregory kept Henry waiting in
the snow for three days at the castle of Canossa before relenting
and lifting the excommunication.
The power of the Papacy has also been endangered by
mundane interference in the appointment of the Catholic
Church's higher clergy. The question of kings and emperors
electing bishops was discussed at length at the Council of
Worms in 1122. It was there decided that kings may give a
bishop temporal power, but only the Pope can grant spiritual
power.
The dispute over the appointment of bishops was
important for it determined who would have say in the deploy-
ment of power in western Mythic Europe. After all, bishops
were both churchmen and feudal landholders, owing service to
both the Pope and their kings. By claiming authority in the
appointment of bishops, the Pope seized control over much of
Mythic Europe and the loyalty of those governing Mythic
Europe.
A final threat to the Papacy was posed from within the
Catholic Church itself. The conciliar movement, begun by
Church scholars opposed to the claim that the Pope may be
judged by no man, contended that the general council of
churchmen had power over the Pope. That is, only the general
Church was without error; its leader could be found at fault.
This important movement continues even now, generating
many letters, decrees, and Bulls to challenge the Pope's au-
tonomy.
Sacraments
The sacraments are the seven rites of the Christian Church.
They are paths to holiness, and must be performed by a priest
or higher official in the Church.
Baptism introduces a child to the Church, and cleanses the
soul of original sin. In most communities, a child is christened
within a year of birth. Until baptism, the soul is stained by
original sin, and may not go to Heaven upon death. Water is
usually used as an outward sign of the cleansing of the spirit
during baptism-
- the stain of sin is washed away.
Confirmation brings a person fully into the Church, and is
performed after a child has been taught about the Church and
Christ. The child professes faith, and promises to renounce
evil.
The eucharist is the point in the Mass which commemo-
rates the Last Supper of Christ. During the eucharist a priest
approaches the altar, raises Cup, filled with wine, and Wafer.
They become the Flesh and Blood of the Lord. Only the priest
may drink of the wine, but the wafer is given to the congrega-
tion. The eucharist is the common bond of all Christians, and
is the sacrament of their redemption by the death and resurrec-
tion of Christ.
Matrimony binds a man and woman in holy wedlock,
which may not be dissolved save by special dispensation from
the Pope. Marriage is for life. Marriage also symbolizes the
union of Christ and his people.
Ordination may only be performed by a bishop or higher
priest. It admits a person as a member of the clergy, allowing
another to perform all the sacraments of their rank.
Absolution is the cleansing of the soul, and is granted by
clergy after a person's sincere confession. A priest may assign
tasks for a sinner to perform, based on the degree and amount
of sin. Absolution only clears the soul of those sins confessed.
Confession and absolution are usually performed before battle,
so that a knight may go to God if killed. Absolution is also
known as shriving.
The last of the sacraments, unction, also known as the last
rites, cleanses the soul of a dying person so that his or her soul
may enter Heaven after final judgment. Last rites are given after
the final confession of a dying person. If there is no priest
available the final unction may be given by a layman. For a
priest to refuse to give last rites is to damn the would-be
recipient's soul to Hell.

Saints and
Sainthood
Saints are particularly holy men and women accepted into
Heaven upon death (most people must spend time in Purgatory
before entering Heaven). Because saints have entered Heaven,
they are able to intercede for living people with God, so that
God may forgive humanity's sins. This forgiveness is the basic
theory behind indulgences and the transference of grace.
Saints may also be prayed to as individuals, and many are
recognized for specific actions. For instance, St. Anthony,
canonized in A.D. 1231, is the patron saint of travelers. Cities,
countries, and guilds often have patron saints, some have more
than one. The authenticity of some is even questioned, and
secret orders operating in cities sometimes present demonic
allies as saints, to undermine Christian faith.
Saints date from the earliest days of the Christian Church.
All the apostles are saints, as are many missionaries and
martyrs. Early saints were acclaimed by cults, which formed
during the saints' lives or after their deaths. But, since 1171 only
the Pope may officially canonize a saint. Not all saints (i.e.,
those of a local area) are recognized by the Church, so commu-
nities send representatives to the Lateran to offer proof of
miracles and justification for the canonization of their local
hero. Unfortunately, simple locals can be duped into believing
a malicious Magus or demon is a divine servant, and petition for
the being's canonization.
The lives of many early saints are not known, but parts
played by more recently canonized saints in the progress of the
Church is well known. Many recentsaints (St. Francis of Assisi,
St. Dominic, St. Clare of Assisi) have founded religious orders,
while others, such as St. Anthony, are known for their teach-
ings.
To canonize a saint, the Church must gather evidence of
miracles performed during the person's lifetime or after death.
One priest, the Devil's Advocate, tries to explain the miracles as
part of the natural process, or the intervention of another saint.
If the evidence given on behalf of the candidate outweighs the
arguments of the Devil's Advocate, the Pope, in a special
ceremony in the Lateran Church, declares the person a saint.
The Church has recently begun an investigation into the
life of Alice de Montrevault, a supposed miracle-worker and
holy woman in the city of Montrevault, France. During her life,
Alice performed many witnessed miracles of healing and
vision, including fainting upon the death of Pope Innocent Ill,
days before word of his death had reached the town.
To properly understand Alice's role and her miracles, the
Church needs investigators who can study her life and her
miracles. There are rumors that Alice was in fact a servant of
the Devil, or a Hermetic Magus in disguise. The Devil's
Advocate on the case, Father Andre of the Dominicans, is
seeking Magi who are willing to explain how miracles such as
Alice's could be performed through the use of the "natural"
process of magic. Such cooperation could be the first step

toward Church acceptance of Magi as a natural part of the
world, or it could merely be a trick to cause members of the
Order to expose themselves to Inquisitional examination.
SAINT MARY
St. Mary is the Madonna, the Blessed Virgin, the mother of
Jesus. In the Orthodox Church she is known as Theotokos, the
Mother of God. Canonized in A.D. 431 by the Council of
Ephesus, Mary has always been venerated above all other
saints. Her unique position as the Mother of Christ lends her
a warmth and humanity other saints lack. At the Day of
Judgment she is expected to intercede for sinners, and prayers
to her are supposed to have great strength. The ideals of
chivalry are in great part focused on the Madonna. Her
following is greatest in southern France, and the court of
Eleanor of Aquitaine was modeled on her virtues. The Aquitaine
court still touts Mythic Europe's strongest veneration for the
Blessed Virgin.
A group of knights in Bordeaux has recently begun a
movement to form a new military order, the Knights of the
Madonna. Supporters of the movement believe there are
pagan, Muslim, and wizardly enemies in France, so petition the
Pope to create a new Crusade against this "foe," a foe which is
close to home.
Thus far the Pope has not formally recognized the Knights
of the Madonna, nor has he taken action on their request for a
crusade against Hermetic Magi. However, some Magi within
the Order (particularly in the Normandy Tribunal are pushing
their brethren to take action before a crusade is declared. The
leaders of the Normandy Tribunal feel the Knights of the
Madonna must be stopped, but realize that no trace of their
elimination may lead to the Order (such a mistake would only
trigger the crusade the Magi are trying to prevent). Other
Tribunals, with less reason to fear the Knights of the Madonna,
warn Normandy Tribunal it will be held responsible for any
violation of the Code that results from involvement in mun-
dane affairs.
Seven Deadly Sins
The Christian world view identifies seven sins as particu-
larly evil, given their terribly corrupting effect on the soul.
The sin of Pride causes a person to place himself or herself
above others, and can lead to a sense of superiority over God.
Lust blinds a person to devotion to God, leading the weak to
seek pleasure and gratification. Envy makes a person resent
what is had, desiring what another has instead of concentrating
on personal piety. Anger leads one to commit atrocities, and to
stray from Christ's teachings. Covetousness is the desire for
another's possessions, leading a person away from the soul.
The contrast between Envy and Covetousness is that the
covetous person does not resent what is had, but simply wants
others' goods.) The Glutton seeks pleasure from food and

drink, to the detriment of the soul. (Gluttony and Lust are
usually bound. ) Sloth makes one delinquent in prayer and
attendance at Church.
Many demons are the personification of a Cardinal Sin,
such as Lilith, the Demon of Lust. The Church keeps lists of
demons encountered, along with their attributes and sins, in an
effort to aid exorcists in their task of casting out Infernal
influences from the faithful. Books of these demonic lists are
sent to bishops and archbishops, who store them in the most
secure vaults of the Church. Diabolists also keep such lists, to
better summon and control known demons.
Excommunication and
Interdict
When a sinner transgresses the laws of God and remains
impenitent, the only recourse the Church has is to cast the
sinner from the community of Christians. This act is known as
excommunication (from the Latin "to put out of the commu
nity").
The excommunicate is not allowed the sacraments until he
repents of his deeds and begs to return to the fellowship of
Christians. No priest will perform the marriage of an excom
municate, and if a person dies excommunicate, he may not be
buried in sanctified ground. However, his children can still be
baptized, as the excommunicate's sin does not exclude descen-
dents from Christian fellowship. However, those who give aid
or succor to an excommunicate are themselves cast out. And,
subjects of a ruler who becomes excommunicate are no longer
bound by oaths sworn to that ruler.
Interdiction is a much more powerful form of excommu
nication, for it places an entire city or country under ban.
Baptism is still performed, but the other sacraments are with-
held from area's people. As interdiction places the soul of every
man, woman and child in an area in peril, it usually invokes
wholesale desertion from the offending cause which inspired
the interdiction. The threat posed to the collective soul puts
intense pressure on the ruler of the area to heal the breach with
the Church.
Both excommunication and interdiction can and have
been used as means to force the Church's political views on a
person or country. Just the threat of excommunication is often
sufficient to reform an offender.
Excommunication and interdict can also be subtly used by
temporal rulers. King John of England quarreled with the
Papacy over the selection of the Archbishop of York, causing
the Pope to place all of England under interdict. Later, John's
capitulation and his oaths of homage to the Pope saved his
throne. As King Philip Augustus of France was simultaneously
preparing an invasion of England, the Pope was quick to
threaten Philip with interdiction if the invasion continued;
England was now a fief of the Papacy.

Excommunication and interdiction are not often threats to
the Order of Hermes as Magi and Covenants in the Order are
usually outside the social order of Mythic Europe, so have their
lives changed little by Christian ostracism. However, Cov-
enants that operate under a socially acceptable facade, and
suffer excommunication or interdiction because of some action
or event, can ruin their station in society and endanger their
existence as a Covenant. Such an ostracized Covenant becomes
open to Inquisition.
Inquisition
The detection and abolition of heresy has long plagued the
Christian Church. In A.D. 1231, Pope Gregory IX issues the
Bull Excommunicamus, which establishes an Inquisition to
locate and try heretics. Gregory IX assigns the task to the
mendicant orders, particularly the Dominicans. In 1252, Pope
Innocent IV legalizes the use of torture to gain a confession.
Inquisitional tribunals are established under two judges,
appointed by the Pope. Evidence must be given by at least two
witnesses, who remain anonymous. The suspect must give his
evidence on oath. If a confession of heresy is made, the person
may recant his heresy and be given a canonical pardon. If no
confession is given, the heretic is given to the secular authori-
ties for execution (normally by burning at the stake).
Since the founding of the Inquisition, some tribunals have
developed a reputation for persecuting the innocent at the
behest of the wealthy and powerful. Such tribunals accept only
one result - execution - and naturally are feared by those
subject to their decrees. The Inquisition has no power over
cases of witchcraft, paganism or diabolism, unless heresy can
be cited as an attendant condition.
In Age, the Inquisitional tribunal has tortured hundreds
oflaymen accused of the heresies of Albigenses and Waldenses.
The tribunal is led by the Benedictine monk Jean de Moissac.
The Benedictine Abbey of St. Giles has also recently received
many large bequests from the local nobility. Rumors in
Narbonne have that the Inquisitional tribunal is pursuing the
personal enemies of those who give them gifts, regardless of the
accused's innocence or guilt.
The Bishop of Narbonne has formed a small party from the
military orders to observe the activities of the tribunal to
determine whether Jean de Moissac is acting within the restric-
tions of the Papal. Bull and, more specifically, whether his
tribunal should be terminated.
Indulsence
An indulgence grants a member of the Church remittance
for sins through the grace of Christ and the saints. In theory,
indulgences are given by the Church for exceptional service to
the cause of Christianity. Such service includes going on
Crusade, aiding the building of churches and cathedrals, and
aiding the poor or elderly. In reality, grants of land or money
to the Church also gain a sinner an indulgence, which leads to
the wholesale buying of grace.

Pardoners are special agents of the Church, tasked with
distributing indulgences. They are normally traveling priests,
dispensing indulgences for a fee to sinners in the towns they
visit. Pardoners are despised by town clergy, since pardoners
take money which would otherwise go to the town church.
More enterprising Pardoners sometimes go to areas known
for their heresy, hoping to make a fortune from those who
realize their sin.
A Pardoner visiting a German Hermetic
Covenant is said to have made twelve sales of salvation in one
night, the night of Allhallows Eve, 1198.
pilgrimage
The idea of pilgrimage, to travel to the site of holy relics or
places, stems from two ancient Christian ideas. The first is that
all of life is a journey toward God. The second is that certain
places or relics are foci for the Holy Spirit. Thus, to visit the
shrine of a saint or a holy place is to move closer to God. A
journey to the earthly city of Jerusalem is in essence a journey
to the heavenly city of God.
Pilgrims are given privileges to aid them on their way.
They may spend the night at religious establishments, are
exempt from tolls or fees for the use of roads and bridges, and
are protected by Church law from attack by other Christians.
Any lord or knight foolish enough to attack a party of pilgrims
risks excommunication by the Church. Even pilgrims to the
Holy Land are sometimes protected from the attack of Saracens,
though such protections are bought or are part of peace treaties.

between crusaders and Saracen kings. The Templars and
Hospitallers originated as guards for the pilgrimage routes
through the Holy Land, and the Knights of Santiago, in Spain,
were formed for the same purpose.
The donations brought by pilgrims, and the money they
pay for accommodations, greatly enriches churches and cities
visited on the pilgrimage trail. The three greatest shrines
places journeyed to on the trail
are the Holy City of
Jerusalem, the city of Rome, and the Cathedral of St. James of
Campostela in Santiago, Spain. Other less important shrines
are Canterbury, site of the murder of St. Thomas a Becket; cities
and towns in the Holy Land associated with the life of Christ;
Mont St. Michel on the coast of Brittany; and many local
shrines. Many cities and towns along the pilgrim trails have
shrines to local saints as well.
Some enterprising Church leaders organize tours ofshrines.
So, for instance, a group of pilgrims from England on their way
to Rome might visit shrines in St. Albans, outside of London;
Canterbury; Mont St. Michel; Chartres; Tours; Le Puy; Arles;
Marseille; Turin; and Rome. On their way back they might visit
Naples, sail to Barcelona, walk across Spain to Santiago, and
then finally return to England. Such a trip takes the better part
of a year to complete. Pilgrimages to the Holy Land often take
three or four years.



Monasticism
Monasticism has its roots in the early years of the Christian
Church, when clergy felt the need to retreat from the world to
contemplate the wonder of God. Two traditions of this isolated
life were initiated, one of the solitary hermit, who retreats from
contact with all others, the other of clergy who form commu-
nities, living by strict rules and observances. The word "monk"
means alone, but is now used to designate a member of a
monastic order.
Most orders base their rule (the set of requirements and
actions allowed to a monk) on the Rule of St. Benedict, the most
famous of the rules of the monastic orders. The Rule of Saint
Benedict is based on the idea that a monk's day is to be
encompassed by manual labor in the monastery garden, spiri-
tual reading, and prayer. The monk also swears a number of
vows, including some or all of obedience, stability, poverty,
chastity, and humility.
The precedents set by the Benedictines eventually lost
favor, though, when monks following the rules clearly abused
them.
For instance, where abbeys were supposed to be
impoverished, many were extremely wealthy. Indeed, the
Mythic European custom of leaving one's possessions to a
monastery quickly made the monasteries rich, as that wealth
was not often dispensed to the poor and needy. Rather, abbeys
held huge tracts ofland, with all the appropriate obligations and
benefits. And, of course, this wealth encouraged sin, especially
greed, gluttony, and improper conduct.
Dissatisfaction with the wealth and corruption of the
Benedictines encouraged many monks to create their own
rules. The greatest of these new orders is the Cistercian, named

after the monastery of Citeaux. Though many new orders arise
in the Thirteenth Century, their proliferation is eventually
halted by the Fourth Lateran Council, in A.D. 1215, which
stipulates that founders of new orders must choose and follow
one of the existing rules.
TYPES OF ORDERS
Most orders are of two types: contemplative (or monastic),
and active (or mendicant). Contemplative orders attempt to
reach an inner peace by retiring from the world, while active
orders work among the populace for the good of the world.
Members of contemplative orders are called monks and nuns,
while those in mendicant orders are called friars and sisters.
Regardless of type, monasteries are often centers of learn-
ing, since monks value literacy among their skills. In fact, the
Benedictine Rule (which is still one orders may follow) requires
that part of the day be spent in reading, and a further part in
copying, illuminating, or binding books.
Many of the mendicant orders adopt the custom of the
third order, which allows a layman to benefit from association
with an order without having to become a friar or sister. The
third order is popular, as its members are regarded as clergy and
can only be tried by canon law, making them exempt from
secular authority. However, the order forbids the use of
weapons except by special dispensation from the head of the
order, making the third order less popular with the knightly
class (though older knights sometimes join after retiring from
military life).
Lesser sons of noble houses (or even unwanted heirs) are
often consigned to monasteries by their parents, and nobles of
pious demeanor often join willingly. While the vows of
monastic orders are for life, the orders are known to make
exceptions in the case of a noble house where the only living
heir is a monk. However, the orders often refuse to release the
monk, so that they may inherit the land. In this way many of
the orders have grown very wealthy.
HERMETIC RELATIONS
Relations between monasteries and Magi of the Order of
Hermes vary. Some orders (like the Dominicans and Beguines)
view Magi as outside the Church, and therefore not worthy of
trust. Others (such as the Conventual Franciscans and the
Cistercian Order) have had more exposure to Magi, so view
them more lepiently. However, such generalizations cannot
cover the varied reactions which Magi inspire from monks of
all orders.
Regardless of relations between monasteries and Coy-
enants, the two are essentially the same. Both are filled with
people devoted to callings, be it to God or the Gift, and who
isolate themselves from the world to pursue their devotion.
Accordingly, good relations based on common philosophy
might be expected between monasteries and Covenants. How.

ever, the insular nature of each small society makes internal
corruption and incestuousness rife, and each society recog-
nizes such evil in the other but not in itself.
AUGUSTINIAN CANONS
Augustinian canons live under the rule of St. Augustine
and staff many cathedrals. The canons are a special case among
monks as they are secular clergy living under the rule of the
order. The Augustinian order is the equivalent of a guild for the
staff of cathedrals, rather than a monastery or begging order
The canons maintain their cathedrals, leading services, hearing
confession, and taking care of day-to-day operations. They also
assist the local bishop by performing priestly functions for him,
allowing him to administer to the diocese.
Augustinian canons are most influential in Rome, south-
erm Germany, and Lorraine. In addition to staffing cathedrals,
Augustinian houses tend to the sick and to pilgrims. Most
Augustinian houses that are not cathedral chapters are small
numbering no more than a dozen canons and a prior.
AUSTIN FRIARS
Pope Alexander IV creates the Austin order in A.D. 1256
from a combination of several Italian orders, including the
Orthodox Waldensians. The mendicant friars of this order live
the Apostolic life in towns, doing good works. They are likely
to be found caring for the sick and poor, or giving children the
rudiments of education. Austin Friars are very active in the
universities of Italy and Sicily, and at least one or two can be
found at universities elsewhere in Mythic Europe. Austins
often take teaching positions at universities, tending toward the
subject of theology.
BEGUINES
The Beguines are a mendicant order of urban women,
often wealthy, who minister to the poor and ill. They take no
vows, but normally remain celibate. The Beguines are most
prominent in the cities of Brabant, Flanders, and in the
Rhineland, though a few Beguines can be found elsewhere,
especially in the communes of Lombardy.
Local rulers, both secular and ecclesiastic, tend to look
with disfavor on mendicant women, and many bishops have
petitioned the Pope to force them into convents. However, the
Beguines have not been formally recognized by the Pope, and
are often associated with the Albigensians, though no charges
of heresy have yet been leveled against them. The Beguines are
perched on the fine line dividing heresy and acceptance, and
individual bishops or inquisitors can rule for or against them
There is a male counterpart to the Beguines, known as the
Beghards.

BENEDICTINES
The Rule of St. Benedict is the most famous of the rules of
the monastic orders. It is based on the ideal that a monk's day
is to be encompassed by manual labor, sometimes in the
monastery garden, but more often in copying manuscripts;
spiritual reading; and prayer. Benedictine monks swear obedi-
ence (their chief vow), stability (staying with the monastery),
and conversion of morals. They also espouse poverty, chastity
and humility, but rarely follow the first and only follow the
other two as suits their needs. Finally, the Benedictine Rule
assumes the majority of monks will not be ordained into
priests, so few priests are resident at monasteries to perform the
sacraments.
Each Benedictine monastery is self-contained and distinct
from other monasteries. They are often located in untraveled
areas, or in areas which are not heavily populated. However,
the Rule of Saint Benedict provides a way for families to present
children to a monastery to be raised as monks, so the monastery
acts as a home for orphans and unwanted children, but also has
brethren for the future.
Formed in the Sixth Century, the Benedictine order be
came very wealthy given land grants from secular rulers who
wished to guarantee their way to Heaven. Most Benedictine
abbeys now own vast tracts of land, and the monks and abbots
live a grand life, acting much like temporal nobles, hunting and
feasting. More recent orders are, for the most part, rejections
of the Benedictine order, which stress a return to Apostolic
poverty.
While many in the Church consider the Benedictines too
worldly, their power has not been diminished by their corrup.
tion. They are a very wealthy order, and hold land in fief in most
of Mythic Europe's kingdoms. However, the order's obedience
to feudal overlords is much less than that of secular lords
Accordingly, more than one king has pressed the Lateran to
force the Benedictines to give up their lands or be forced to
accept the responsibilities which come with a fief. Thus far
such efforts to pressure the Benedictines have come to naught
In the farming district west of Munich lies the Benedictine
monastery of Albrecht. The Prior of the monastery, Father
Gunter, and his monks have been developing a reputation for
hedonistic practices, a reputation far worse than any garnered
by a Benedictine house. The monks are taking large donations
of grain, coin, and service from the community. In return, they
offer only recriminations and calls for increased piety.
In truth the monastery is plagued by the demon Fenzeral
who has taken the form of a young monk, Brother Anton. He
has drawn the monks away from the sacraments, perverting
their masses into diabolic services. The once-pious monks
have one by one fallen either to temptation or to the claws of
Fenzeral. Now, they are unredeemably proud and gluttonous,
considering themselves deserving of the best the land has to
offer, all in return for their lives of "piety" and "service to the
Church."
CARMELITES
The Carmelites are a mendicant monastic order, but one
started from separate groups of hermits on the slopes of Mt.
Carmel, in the Holy Land. The order flees the Muslims in A.D.
1238, and develops chapters throughout Mythic Europe. The
majority of chapters may be found in Spain, England, Sicily,
and Italy.
The Carmelites pattern themselves after the Dominicans
in their aims and goals. They practice abstinence, silence, and
fasting, living as hermits with a common church. Carmelite
monasteries are likely to be found in the wilderness, or se-
cluded behind town walls. The Carmelites do not encourage
gifts of land or money, preferring to be given just enough land
for them to farm for their own needs. In this way they hope to
avoid the problems which plague the Benedictines and other
wealthy orders.
CARTHUSIANS
The Carthusians embrace the life of the hermit. Each
monk has a personal cell, wherein eating, sleeping, and prayer
occur. But, all house members meet for holy offices in the
monastery church. Lay brothers till the soil and provide labor
needed to run the monastery. Unlike the Carmelites, the
Carthusians actively seek land, which they often rent to sur-
rounding communities in return for money or goods.
CISTERCIAN ORDER
The Cistercian order is a contemplative monastic order
founded by Robert, abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Molesme,
who grew weary of the laxity of the Benedictines. His order,
named after the first house in Citeaux, France, returned to strict
observance of the Benedictine Rule.
The Cistercian order was expanded by St. Bernard, abbot
of Clairveaux. St. Bernard rejected the customary donations of
wealth which other orders supported themselves on. Instead,
he turned to the charity of the many to support the Cistercians,
avoiding the temptations of wealth which had marred the
reputation of the Benedictines.
The Cistercian order provides for two kinds of monks:
choir monks, many of whom are ordained priests who spend
their time writing and illuminating books or performing other
sedentary labor, and lay brothers, who till the fields and do
manual labor in the monastery. The suborder of lay brothers
invites non-nobles to lead the monastic life, which most other
orders do not.
The Cistercians build their houses in secluded and solitary
places to better resist worldly temptation. Unlike the
Benedictines, the Cistercians do not rent their land to the local
community, but farm their lands themselves.
Each Cistercian abbot is expected to journey to Citeaux
once a year, to take part in the general chapter of the order.
Some abbots are excused from this journey if their houses are

too far from Citeaux. In addition, each abbot must visit all the
houses which his house has founded. In this way, the order
regulates itself. Such is the wisdom of this plan that the Fourth
Lateran Council, in A.D. 1215, requires all Christian orders to
hold regular chapter meetings.
ORDER OF CLUNY
The Order of Cluny is a contemplative order which grew
out of the Benedictine. The order places much more emphasis
on learning and prayer than do the Benedictines, with lay
brothers farming fields. While the intention of the founders
was to escape the worldliness of the Benedictines, by A.D. 1150
the order had nearly equaled its parent in the accumulation of
material goods.
Brethren of the Order of Cluny spend most of the day in
offices (church ceremony), taking only enough time for meals
and a few hours of sleep a night. Lay brothers farm the lands
of the order, allowing the monks to spend their time at services.
DOMINICANS
Approved by Pope Honorius IIl in A.D. 1216, the Domini-
cans are a mendicant monastic order formed specifically to
bring the Albigensians back to the Church by logic, teaching,
and example. Scholasticism is important to the order, and
many Dominicans may be found at universities, especially at
Paris, Bologna, and Oxford.
Even after the defeat of the

Albigensians in the Crusade against them, the Dominicans
continue to preach against heresy. In fact, many Dominican
friars can be found in Serbia, the Rhineland, and Lombardy,
hotbeds of continued heresy.
A Dominican friar at the University of Bologna has begun
investigating reports of Magi in that city. While he has not yet
gathered any firm evidence or witnesses, he is perilously close
to exposing a Covenant there. Since the decree of the Papal
Bull, which allows torture in Inquisitional interrogations, the
discovery of a secret Covenant could collapse the entire Roman
Tribunal in a wave of persecution. (No one expects a Magus to
hold the identities of fellow Magi secret under torture, regard-
less of the Code.)
Amberitus, the leader of the Covenant, has thus far refused
to leave the university, but other Covenants in the Roman
Tribunal demand that the Covenant either be dissolved or the
Dominican friar silenced.
ORDER OF FONTREVAULT
A contemplative monastic order based in France, the
Order of Fontrevault is a double order, accepting both men and
women, and housing them in double monasteries of monks
and nuns, under the authority of a prioress. The order inspired
the English order of Sempringham. The abbey of Fontrevault
itself contains the tombs of Henry 1l, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and
Richard the Lionheart.



FRANCISCANS
Francis of Assisi is an exuberant young man who lives a life
of pleasure, but a vision of Christ changes his life. He gives away
his money and fine clothes, and gives up the material life,
spending his time taking care of the poor and sick, and
repairing churches. His father disinherits him, claiming he is
a madman, which affects Francis not at all.
As a layman Francis joins the Fifth Crusade in A.D. 1217,
and performs his first miracle when he enters Damietta during
the siege. Francis offers to walk through flames to prove the
power of Christ, on the condition that the Sultan of Egypt leads
his troops for the Christian cause if he emerges unscathed. The
sultan refuses to allow the test, and has Francis escorted back
to the Christian camp.
Francis is horrified by the following sack of Damietta in
1218, and renounces the life of worldly knights, preaching and
practicing apostolic poverty instead. The Sultan of Damascus,
sensing Francis's sanctity, gives him leave to travel freely
throughout the Holy Land, and Francis's followers are given
the right to tend Christian shrines now in Saracen hands.
Francis's observance of true apostolic poverty draws many followers to his cause, even though his religious views are somewhat variant to those of the Church. Pope Innocent Ill
gives his approval to the contemplative Franciscan order and
the Rule of Saint Francis in 1210. An important difference
between Francis's movement, on the one hand, and that of the
Albigensians and other Cathar heresies, on the other, is that
Francis does not demand that the Church practice poverty,
only that his followers do.
Before Francis's death, he also attempts to preach Christianity to Magi. While his intentions are good, and he does convince some Magi to become more devout in the faith of Christ, Francis is not generally welcomed. (Francis himself is
so infused with faith that his mere presence acts as a Dominion
Aura of 3. For a time, some Magi suspect Francis of being a
renegade Magus with a strange Perdo Vim spell in place, a spell
which diminishes the magical power of others.) In truth, most-
Magi do not convert, but relations between Francis and the
Order of Hermes are always cordial.
The Rule of Saint Francis is very strict, and forbids any
Franciscan monk from owning property. After Francis's death
in 1226 some Franciscans try to ease the Rule of St. Francis. The
result is a split between the Conventuals, who own property
against the express wish of Saint Francis, and the Spirituals,
who observe the Rule more literally.
Since Francis's death, the Conventual Franciscans have
maintained good relations with the Covenants of Magi near
their monasteries. The Spiritual Franciscans, on the other
hand, view this tolerance as yet another sign that the Conventuals
have drifted from the "true path" as laid out by Saint Francis.

HUMILIATI
The Humiliati are a mendicant monastic order drawn from
the nobility of Italy and Lombardy. The Humiliati live the
Apostolic life, administering to the poor and diseased. They
live in double monasteries of monks and nuns, or as laymen and
women. The Humiliati were forbidden to preach by the Third
Lateran Council, in A.D. 1179, and were actually excommuni-
cated by Lucius lIl. Innocent I re-organized the Humiliati into
a triple order: celibate laity, married laity, and canons and
sisters in double monasteries. The laity have the right to
preach, as long as they only exhort the Christian life and do not
speak on matters of theology.
The Humiliati have also developed a method of weaving
extremely fine woolen cloth, nearly as thin as silk. Many Italian
cities claim the Humiliati have demonic aid in their enterprise,
and have begun a campaign to have the order declared a heresy.
POOR CLARES
The Poor Clares is a sister order to the Franciscans,
founded by Clare of Assisi. She joins Francis of Assisi at the age
of eighteen, much against the wishes of her family. Her sister
Agnes joins her soon afterward. Their father sends twelve
armed men to bring Agnes back, but Clare's prayers make her
so heavy that the men are unable to budge her.
The Poor Clares follow a strict rule, enjoining absolute
poverty, mortification of the flesh, and austerity. Pope Inno-
cent Ill guarantees their absolute poverty, but Pope Gregory IX
tries to make the order accept the ownership of property, and
income from rent. However, Clare speaks with the Pope, and
such is her conviction that Gregory also grants the right of
absolute poverty to the order. However, a few houses of the
order accept property, mirroring the split of the Franciscans.
Those Poor Clares who accept the ownership of property are
known as Urbanists.
PREMOSTRATENSIAN
ORDER
A mendicant monastic order of reformed Augustinians,
the Premonstratensians are greatly influenced by the Cistercian
order. They stress preaching and pastoral work. The order
started as a double order of monks and nuns, living in double
monasteries of men and women. However, the presence of
both sexes under one roof had predictable results, and separate
monasteries and nunneries were established in the 1140s and
1150s. In A.D. 1198 the order dissolved the nunneries, and
admits no more women, henceforth being composed solely of
monks.
Each morning the brothers leave the monastery to beg and
preach among the villages and towns which surround them.
They also tend to the sick and poor, and often help farmers at
their chores. In return, the surrounding populace gives the

monastery part of the fruit of the field, in addition to food given
to individual members of the order during the day. The order
keeps a small portion of food for its own use, and distributes the
rest at almshouses built into the outer wall of the monastery.


Military Orders
The military orders of the Catholic Church combine the
monastic life with the life of a soldier. Members of the military
orders are the soldiers of the Church, and are found where the
Christian world borders the lands of Muslims or pagans.
Members of these orders swear the normal monastic vows of
poverty, humility, and obedience, but must also be proficient
with weapons. These orders also stress military discipline. For
example, no knight may charge on his own, but only at the
order of his superior officer. All the military orders recruit their
members from the aristocracy, though non-nobles also have
their place in orders, as sergeants or footmen.
The three greatest of the Church's military orders are the
Templars and Hospitallers in the Holy land, and the Teutonic
order in the Baltic region. The Templars and Hospitallers
recruit mainly in France, Italy, and England, while the Teu-
tonic order recruits solely in Germany.
All the military orders are rich from gifts of land and
money, and use this wealth to support their castles and garri-
sons on the frontier. In Spain the Reconquista (the requisition
of Spain from the Muslims) is supported by numerous small
orders, which fill the void left when the Templars and

Hospitallers pulled out of the country, incapable of supporting
garrisons in two widely separated areas of the world. The
Spanish orders recruit wherever they can, but the great major-
ity of their members come from the Spanish kingdoms (and the
Order of Hermes).

TEMPLARS
Founded in A.D. 1115 by Hugh de Payans and eight
companions as a guard for pilgrims in the Holy Land, the
Templars were the first of the Christian military orders. They
modified the Rule of the Cistercian order, and are affiliated with
the Cistercians. Their sole allegiance, however, is to the Pope.
The war in the Holy Land is a Holy War for the Templars.
The Templars swear vows of personal poverty and chastity. For
religious reasons they also bathe very infrequently, a remark-
able condition in the Holy Land, where Latins largely adopt the
Muslim custom of bathing at least once a week. Templars also
view the hardships of war, especially in the harsh climate of the
Holy Land, as a spiritual exercise much like fasting or the
wearing of a hair shirt. And, the knights are so devoted to their
cause that they refuse to retreat, even against overwhelming
odds.
King Baldwin Il of Jerusalem gave the Templars a portion
of the Temple of Solomon for their headquarters, from which
they take their name. They also have lands in Mythic Europe,
given to them by secular nobles, and retain the lands of their
members, who are recruited from the noble class. This does not
mean to say that all members of the order are nobility. The
order accepts people from more humble backgrounds, who are
ranked sergeants. The order even recruits chaplains, priests
who accompany soldiers in the field, and who are given military
training if they do not already have it.
The Templars do not act solely as religious warriors. They
also act as bankers, holding money for crusaders and pilgrims.
In fact, the wealth of the Templars has generated much jealousy
among secular kings and princes, who lose both land and men
to the order. Unfortunately, the order's wealth seems to have
corrupted it. Rumors of demonic rites, Black Masses, and
defilement of holy objects have started to circulate. The Pope
has so far ignored these rumors, and a number of bishops and
lords who have questioned the order's piety have mysteriously
disappeared.
The Templars wear a white mantle with a red cross.

HOSPITALLERS
The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem (better known as the
Hospitallers) originated as a Benedictine hospital for pilgrims,
located near the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. The Hospitallers
grew quickly, and soon had a number of caravansaries and
hospitals throughout the Holy Land. Because of the need to
defend its holdings, and having received the gift of a number of
castles, the order became a military order under the sole
jurisdiction of the Pope, soon rivaling the Templars.

The Hospitallers, with their Templar rivals, defended the
Holy Land against the Saracens, losing most of the order in A.D.
1187 at the battle of Hattin. The Saracen leader Saladin killed
all knights of the Hospitallers and Templars that he captured,
for fear of their military strength and unreasoning hatred of
Islam. Still, the Hospitallers held onto their castles, and
recruited more knights from their lands in France, England,
and Germany.
Even after becoming a military order of the Church, the
Hospitallers never gave up their hospital work, and members
of the order often act as chirurgeons in the field, taking care of
the wounded after battles.
Until 1259, the Hospitallers wear a black cloak or surcoat,
with a whitecross. In 1259 they adopt ared surcoat with a white
cross on the left breast.
TEUTONIC ORDER
The Teutonic order began as a hospital founded by the
Cistercian order, but in A.D. 1 198 they became a military order
based around Tripoli and Antioch. Because of the strong
presence of the Templars and Hospitallers in Syria and the Holy
Land, the Teutonic order deals with heresies elsewhere, par-
ticularly northern Mythic Europe, where it recruits its mem
bers from the German noble class.
**In 1228 prince Conrad of Poland comes to an agreement
with Herman of Salza, the order's Grand Master. The Polish
prince gives land along the Baltic coast to the order, which uses
it as a base for crusades against the pagans. In twenty years, the
order conquers all of Prussia, which had resisted the Poles for
hundreds of years.** The order thus expands up the Baltic coast,
and attempts to move inland toward Russia.
Moving into Russia, the Teutonic knights find new en-
emies to fight. In 1241 the Grand Master of the order, along
with many knights, is killed fighting the Mongols at the battle
of Leignitz. A year later the order suffers another major defeat
at the hands of Alexander Nevsky, Prince of Novgorod, at the
battle of Lake Peipus.
A military order associated with the Teutonic knights is
that of the Brethren of the Sword, founded by the Bishop of Riga
in 1204 to fight the pagans of Finland. By 1237 the Brothers are
decimated, losing more than half their number in battles with
the pagans. They eventually merge with the Teutonic order,
but retain their own leadership under the Hochmeister of the
Teutonic order.
The Teutonic knights are identified by a white cloak or
surcoat with a black cross, while the Brethren wear a white
cloak or surcoat with a red cross and sword.

SPANISH MILITARY
ORDERS
The Christian reconquest of Spain from the Saracens
demanded the same type of military order the Crusades had
used in the Holy Land. However, neither the Templars nor the
Hospitallers were willing to make great commitments in Spain.
In their stead, a number of Spanish military orders were
formed.
The greatest of these are the Knights of Calatrava. In 1157,
the Templars abandoned the castle of Calatrava and a group of
Navarrese knights and Cistercian monks took it over. The
monks soon returned to their abbey, and the knights were
recognized as a military order. The Knights of Calatrava wear
a white surcoat with no insignia. Their armor is painted black.
Numerous other small Spanish and Portuguese orders
exist, including the Knights of Santiago (and the Knights of San
Thiago, their Portuguese branch); the knights of Alcantara,
who operate in Portugal and Castile; the Brethren of Santa
Maria, a Portuguese order which changes its name to the
Knights of Aviz after capturing that town; the Knights of St.
Julian, who operate mostly on the borders of Castile and Leon;
and the Knights of Our Lady of Montjoie, who merge with the
Knights of Calatrava in 1221.


Heresy
Heresy is what the Church considers an affront to the
Church and it precepts, and the superiority of God. Heretics are
usually people or movements branded as offenders of the
Church, and are thus declared enemies of the Church. To be
branded a heretic means to have almost all devout Christians
in Mythic Europe opposed to you and your beliefs. And, to be
branded a heretic often means having Christian authorities,
like Inquisitors and military orders, directed against you.
Furthermore, Fundamental Christianity follows the te-
nets of the councils of **Nicaea and Chalcedon**, and the decrees
of the Popes, but heretics question these antecedents. People
branded heretics by the Church are typically critical of the
wealth and pride of the Church, and like only a few of the
Christian religious orders, usually demand poverty and humil-
ity of their number. In response to heresy the Church created
the Holy Office of the Inquisition, and gives great power to
Inquisitors, even allowing them to use torture in their search for
opposition to the Church.
There are a number of heretical sects in the Catholic
Church which espouse beliefs the Pope has declared heresy.
The sects include the Adoptionists, the Brethren of the Free
Spirit, the False Apostles, the Waldensians, and the Manicheans,
who include the Cathars, Bogomils, and Albigensians



ADOPTIONIST HERESY
The Adoptionist Heresy maintains that Jesus was not the
true Son of God, but was made so by adoption through the
medium of baptism. The concept of adoptionism was most
prevalent in the Eighth Century in Spain, but the topic is still
one under theological discussion today.
ALBIGENSIAN HERESY
See Manicheanism
ARIANISM
Preached by Arius of Alexandria during the reign of
Constantine the Great, the Arian heresy declared that the
earthly body of Jesus Christ was merely the dwelling of the
Word of God, rather than the Word incarnate. The heresy was
suppressed in the Roman Empire, but spread widely among the
Germanic tribes in outlying regions. The Goths were the first
tribe to become Arian Christians, and they in turn sent mission-
aries to other tribes, so that new kingdoms built on the ruins of
the Empire were ruled by Arian Christians. The heresy
flourished during the years between the fall of the Empire and
the rise of the Franks, during the capture of the north African
coast by the Byzantines, and during the missionary work of
Catholic priests in Spain.
BOGOMIL HERESY
See Manicheanism
BRETHREN OF THE FREE
STIRIT
In an attempt to reconcile the writings of Aristotle and
Christian thinking, the Brethren of the Free Spirit believe in the
superiority of the human will above all else, even God. The
brethren are most prevalent in Swabia and the Rhineland.
They are declared heretics and excommunicate in A.D.
1235, but neither the nobles of the area, nor the Inquisition are
able to eradicate them. The Brethren are welcome in many
cities, though they must keep their presence a secret, as their
hosts would share their excommunication.
The popes do not call a crusade on the Brethren, being
involved in other crusades, and, later in the Thirteenth Cen-
tury, fearing the damage another crusade like the Albigensian
Crusade might cause. The German emperors of Mythic Europe
have also proven reticent to move against the sect, as cities are
likely to rise against any military effort to eradicate the heresy.

CATHAR HERESY
See Manicheanism
DONATIST HERESY
Preached by Bishop Donatus of Carthage in the early
Fourth Century, the Donatist heresy proposed that sacraments
performed by sinful priests were invalid. The Church, unwill-
ing to undermine its rites based on the morals of its priests,
declared Donatism a heresy rather than accept it as Church
doctrine.
However, the poor were seduced by the idea - with the
sacraments considered false, the Church lost its influence over
people's morality - and the heresy flourished in north Africa.
The emperors and the Church of the time both took measures
to suppress the heresy, but the followers of Donatus still
prowled the countryside, freeing slaves, robbing the rich, and
sometimes murdering their victims. The Donatists were on
their last legs when the Vandals invaded northern Africa. The
Donatists rejoiced as the Orthodox priests were ejected from
their churches by the Arians, and the heresy was renewed for
a time. However, the heresy may finally have died out when the
Arabs conquered north Africa in the 670s. Certainly no word
has been heard from the Donatists since.

FALSE APOSTLES
A heretical group which lives a radical form of the Franciscan
Apostolic life, the False Apostles are formed by Gerard Segerelli,
a native of Parma who sells all his possessions in A.D. 1260 to
travel and preach. His message includes penance and the
Apostolic life for both his followers and the Church. His
followers are condemned by Popes Honorius IV and Nicholas
IV. Gerard himself is subject to the Inquisition, and burned at
the stake in 1300.
MANICHEANIST
HERESY
**Manicheanism was an early heresy which tried to tie the
Word of Christ to ancient Persian beliefs on the dualism of
nature.** Manicheanism is the predecessor of Catharism. In its
most extreme form, the movement called for extreme austerity
in diet, forbidding the eating of foods which were begotten
sexually (only vegetables were allowed), and denying sex
except for procreation. According to the movement's precepts
extreme poverty was the only way to gain salvation, as worldly
goods only tied one to the mundane world, keeping people
from attaining spiritual enlightenment. Manicheanism spawned
many heresies, including those of the Cathars, Bogomils and
Albigensians.
**Cathars**
The Cathars are descendents of the Manicheaists, dualists
who believe in the essential evil of the material world, which
they say was created by the Devil. Cathars deny the role of God
in creation, and also deny the humanity of Christ. Rejection of
the material world includes abstinence from sex, especially for
the procreation of children who would have to live in the
material world. Apostolic poverty is part of the Cathars' creed,
and they encourage all believers to rid themselves of material
possessions.
Cathars refuse to pay homage to secular leaders and refuse
to swear oaths. The Cathars first came to Mythic Europe
through Bulgaria, where they influenced the Bogomils, and
spread to Provençe, where they are known as Albigensians.
**Bogomils**
The Bogomils are the first Mythic European Cathars, based
in Bulgaria and Serbia, but soon spread to Asia Minor and
Provençe, where they influence the Albigensians. The Bulgar-
ian Bogomils are crushed in A.D. 1211 by King Ivan Il of
Bulgaria, but many still live in Serbia.
**Albigensians**
The Albigensians are a sect of the Cathar heresy, and take
their name from the town of Albi in southern France. They call
themselves Believers, and their traveling teachers are known as

Perfecti. The Perfecti live by begging and preaching.
The
Albigensians preach Apostolic poverty, instructing Believers to
give away land and money, living a life of poverty. They believe
the accumulation of goods and land only focuses the owner on
the material world, and only by divesting of worldly goods may
a person achieve salvation.
The Church, especially its rich
Benedictine monasteries, is a natural target of Perfecti, who
argue that priests need not live in luxury.
The Church tries to suppress the Albigensian heresy by
preaching Catholicism, reminding the people of their original
faith. However, the murder of Peter of Castlenau, a Papal
Legate, prompts the Pope to declare a crusade against the
heretics in A.D. 1208. Many knights from northern France join
the crusade, as the lands of heretical nobles are transferred to
the crusaders. **The leader of the Crusade is Simon de Montfort,
a Norman nobleman**.
Many atrocities are committed by the crusaders, and the
Crusade continues until the massacre of Montsegur in 1244.
The Pope also creates the Holy Office of the Inquisition, which
has the power to investigate and denounce heretics, killing
many and torturing more for information.

MONOPHYSITE HERESY
This heresy was proposed by the Abbot Eutachyes in the
440s and stated that Jesus took no part of the human condition,
but rather was completely divine. Numerous Church councils
took place to decide the issue, and the Sees of Constantinople
and Alexandria were the heads of the two opposing factions, for
and against the proposition.
Though a heresy from fundamental Christianity,
Monophysitism became the religion of Egypt and Syria, and
suffered oppression by Constantinople.
In response the
Monophysites aided Islamic Arabs during their conquests of
Egypt and Syria, welcoming them as liberators from the tyr-
any of Constantinople.
Rumors persist of Monophysite abbeys and churches deep
in Egypt and Arabia, where heretics practice their religion safe
from the authority of the Byzantine Patriarch or Emperor.


NESTORIAN HERESY
Nestor, Patriarch of Constantinople in A.D. 428, preached
that Mary, mother of Jesus, was only the mother of the earthly
body of the Savior, and thus was not worthy of worship.
Nestor's opponents had him removed from the See of
Constantinople, and finally exiled to the Libyan desert after
years of see-saw battles within the Church.
**Nestor's followers retreated to Syria, where they acquainted
the Persians and later the Arabs with the works of Greek
philosophers and scientists**. Nestorians still flourish in the east,
beyond the Holy Land.

WALDENSIANS
The Waldensians were formed in A.D. 1172 by Waldo, a
merchant of Lyon, who gave up his wealth and position to
preach the Apostolic life. The Waldensians were examined by
the Church's Third Lateran Council in 1179, and their lifestyle
was approved, but they were forbidden to preach without
permission from the Bishop of Lyon. The Bishop refused his
permission, and ultimately was forced to excommunicate the
Waldensians, expelling them from Lyon when they continued
to preach in spite of the Church's ruling.
The Waldensians had many successes against the Cathar
heresy, illustrating the faults of the Cathars and their beliefs,
and reaffirming Catholic doctrine. However, the Waldensians'
Scriptural teachings, in the language of the people, and their
belief that Apostolic poverty and the acceptance of Christ were
all that was necessary for salvation alarmed Church authorities.
Accordingly, the Waldensian movement was declared a heresy
by Papal Bull in 1184.
The persecution that follows the Church's decree, in the
Thirteenth Century, does not daunt the Waldensians. They
continue to teach and spread their doctrine to Lombardy,
Spain, and Austria. The primary congregation of the
Waldensians is drawn from those who work the land, as
opposed to the Albigensians, who are largely supported by
nobles.


Islam
Islam is not a heretical offshoot of the Christian faith, but
is a faith in its own right, largely followed by natives of the
Middle East and Africa. Being a unique religion, Islam is seen
as pagan by the Christian Church,
ISLAMIC ORIGINS
Islam is a relatively new religion. Mohammed, its prophet,
lived and preached in the Seventh Century, after Christ. The
word Islam means surrender, and a Muslim is one who surren-
ders his soul to Allah, the one God. Islam has the same roots
as Christianity and Judaism, but proposes that Mohammed is
the last and most perfect prophet, revealing the word of Allah
in the Koran, the sacred book of Islam. Muslims accept Christ
as a prophet of God, but reject his holy nature, and find the
Christian idea of a tripartite God as an unholy aberration which
leads men astray from the path of righteousness.
Mohammed began his preaching in Mecca in the 61Os. He
fled to Medina in A.D. 622, from which event the Muslims
reckon their calendar. In Medina Mohammed's movement
grew, and he led expeditions against the idol-worshipping
tribes of Arabia. **Mohammed reentered Mecca in 630, and died
in 632 in Jerusalem, where he is said to have ascended to
Heaven from the hill where Abraham nearly sacrificed Isaac.**
Mohammed's footprints at the time of his ascension are said to

be visible to the faithful, and the Muslims built the Dome of the
Rock over the site of Mohammed's death, a site which has
become the third greatest holy place of Islam.
Before his death Mohammed united the Arabian peninsula
both politically and religiously, and Arabic became the lan-
guage of Islam. The unification of the Arabic tribes allowed the
caliphs, the successors of Mohammed, to wage war against the
Byzantine and Persian empires. Indeed, between 632 and 656
the Muslims overran Damascus, Jerusalem, Syria, Mesopotamia,
Egypt, and Persia. **By 720, Islam had crossed the sands of the
Sahara Desert, spread into northern Spain and southern France,
and extended to Sind in the east.**
The Muslims still occupy many of those lands in the
Thirteenth Century.
RELIGIOUS
INTERACTION
Muslims pray five time a day, kneeling and facing Mecca.
They fast during the holy month of Rammadan, are expected to
give alms to the poor, observe the Sabbath on Friday, and
pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca at least once in their life.
The Muslims are tolerant of non-believers, allowing them
to continue their worship. Indeed, in Spain, the Archbishop of
Toledo was allowed to remain the primate of Spain, even
though Toledo was in Muslim hands from the early Eighth
Century until its recapture by forces of Castile in 1085. It's true
that under the Muslims non-believers must pay special taxes,
but have few other restrictions.

Unfortunately, Christians tend to be less tolerant of Islam
and largely have unenlightened perspectives on the faith. Many
Christians view Islam as a form of paganism, convinced that it
**calls for the worship of three false Gods: Mahomet, Apollyon,
and Termagant**. Christians also believe Saracens carry images
of these gods before them into battle, and if defeated, curse and
spit on the images. According to Christian understanding, the
law of Mohomet and Termagant is inscribed in a book kept in
Mecca, where the Muslims go every year to worship before a
great black stone. And, Christians believe Muslim sorcerers
summon demons, known as djinn or genies, which they
command to do magical tasks. These false assumptions about
Islam are in part what perpetuates wars against the Muslims.


Judaism
From the Christian viewpoint, Judaism is a special cat-
egory of religion, somewhere between a heresy and paganism,
but certainly different from Christianity.

JEWISH RESPONSE
While the Church acknowledges the influence that Juda-
ism has had on Christianity, the Church must condemn the
self-named chosen people of God, who do not follow Jesus.
To the average Christian in Mythic Europe, Jews are the
people who crucified God, a people who practice a strange
religion, hidden from public view. Stories of the religious
practices of the Jews include the sacrifice of infants and the

drinking of blood. To Mythic Europe's merchants, Jews are a
source of loans and credit, but apply usury (interest) to loans,
something forbidden to Christians.
As a result of their exclusiveness and extortionate business
practices, Jews tend to be natural scapegoats, blamed for
everything from missing children to droughts to famines. Riots
in many cities are directed at the Jews, both to vent frustration
and to nullify debts. Indeed, at one point the Jews of York,
England, are besieged in the local castle by a crowd led by
barons, barons heavily in debt. The Jews kill themselves rather
than face the tortures and cruelties planned for them by the
mob.
The Church's Lateran Council of A.D. 1179 forbade the
charging of interest by Christian moneylenders, but allowed
Jews to do so; Jews are not expected to go to Heaven by the
Catholic Church. However, the Council did decreed that Jews
may not have Christian servants, nor may Christians lodge with
Jews. The Council of 1215 frees Christian debtors, especially
crusaders, from interest on loans from Jews; excludes Jews
from positions of authority; and stipulates that Jews need wear
a badge of identification, either a yellow or scarlet cloth patch
on their clothes.
Christian monarchs in Mythic Europe both support and
abuse Jews. Kings protect and exploit God's chosen people,
making them servants or wards of the crown, but also charging
them heavy taxes. In 1290 King Edward I of England solves the
"Jewish problem" by expelling them from his domains. Many
flee to Germany, Hungary, and Poland.
The Jews are accepted by Muslims, just as Christians are
accepted my Muslims, and the Jewish culture flourishes under
the rule of Islam. Though required to pay special taxes because
of their faith, Jews were allowed greater freedom under Islam
than under Christianity, and many Jews become advisors to
caliphs and other Muslim rulers.
JEWISH PRECEPTS
The Jewish tradition is one of learning and intellectual
development, and Jews have always been connected to univer-
sites and schools in Muslim lands. Jews, free of the restraints
placed on Christians about the dissection of the human body,
have made medicine a special study. Universities in Spain and
Sicily have in turn passed this knowledge to Christians. The

Jews also keep Classic Greek and Roman texts alive, preserving
knowledge otherwise lost in western Mythic Europe. This
knowledge helps form the basis of the Rational Aura, a belief in
facts rather than faith.


Pagansm
By fault (or virtue, depending on perspective) of being
different from Christianity, other religions are declared pagan
by the leaders of the Christian Church. Being pagan, other
religions are therefore the enemies of the Church, though
tenuous relations can be established with some pagan faiths,
like that of Judaism.
Before the death and resurrection of the Christian Lord,
people believed in numerous gods (declared false by the
Church), whether those gods were of the Greeks and Romans,
or of the Vikings. However, the spread of the word of the true
Lord has converted many of those once-pagan peoples, except
for a few on the fringes of the Christian world, like the
Prussians, and those who reject Christianity, like the Muslims.
Those pagans continue to practice their ways today.
Though Christianity has overwhelmed the majority of
pagan religions in Mythic Europe, many pagan festivals and
locations persist within Church domain. In fact, many people
continue to perform pagan ceremonies at the change of the
seasons, or at harvest time. They do so out of superstition, for
fear that the old gods might still exist beyond the veneer of
Christianity. And, if those gods should still exist, the common
person fears angering the gods, making existence all the more
unbearable.
Some churchmen recognize the shadow of paganism in the
various heresies which spring up in the countryside, and try to
suppress pagan ceremonies and holidays. Other priests do not
see peasant ceremonies as a threat to the Catholic Church.
Rather, they use these ceremonies and holidays as times to
preach on the universal nature of the Church. Some pagan
traditions, from the old gods, have even been indoctrinated into
the Christian faith, simply given new names. Indeed, the
crucifix itself is an icon of faiths reaching back beyond Chris-
tianity. The adoption of these old traditions smooths the
transition to Christianity, and appeases followers of old faiths
who would otherwise resist the new "official" religion.

## The crusades
The idea of a Holy War against the enemies of the
Church is relatively new to Christians.
The concept grew out of the reconquest of Spain and
Sicily from pagan invaders, and was inspired by St.
Augustine's concept of divinely inspired violence.

A crusade may only be called by the Pope. Many crusades
are called primarily against Muslims, in the Holy Land and
Spain, but also against the pagans in Poland and Prussia, against
the Albigensian Heresy, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the
Anti-Pope Anacletus. All of these crusades are duly authorized,
and the soldiers involved, while possibly overzealous, are for
the most part devout.
The Crusades attract supporters from all levels of society,
from kings and princes to journeymen and serfs. Many
participants, especially in expeditions to the Holy Land, take
pilgrimage vows, and are protected by the same laws as
pilgrims. For their sacrifices crusaders are also given indul
gences, a free remission of punishment due from sin.
Many crusaders also benefit materially from going on
crusade, gaining lands and titles in conquered territories.
However, material benefits are far outweighed by the spiritual
benefits of serving Christ and the Church. A popular sentiment
holds that it is miserly to refrain from crusading, as you should
give your all to recover the property of Christ.

first Crusade
In A.D. 1071, the Seljuk Turks defeated the army of
Byzantium at a small town named Manzikert, in Asia Minor.
The Turks swept on to conquer most of the Empire in Asia
Minor, and to wrest the Holy Land from the Saracens of Egypt.
Christians on pilgrimage to Jerusalem had long been
protected from attack, deals having been made with the Saracens,
but the Seljuks refused to honor the guarantees made by their
predecessors, and raided and robbed many pilgrim caravans.
Pope Gregory VIl resolved, in 1074, to lead a united army of
western princes to the Holy Land to retake the city of Christ, but
was unable to bring his plans to fruition.
However, in 1095 Pope Urban Il, at the Synod of Clermont,
preached to the leaders of western Mythic Europe of a crusade
to retake Jerusalem. It was agreed that an army would be sent
to the Holy Land to retake Jerusalem and insure the safety of
pilgrims. A white cross was the symbol of the crusaders.
Before the nobles could embark on their crusade, though,
another force was sent in advance of them, but failed to affect
the pagans in the Holy Land. A band of peasants, tens of
thousands strong, marched from France to Byzantium, led by
Peter the Hermit. This army of peasants supported itself by
plundering the countryside on its way, but the Bulgars deci-
mated the army before it even reached Byzantium. However,
the Emperor hastily shipped the remaining peasants across to

Asia Minor to fight in the coming Holy War. Unfortunately, the
peasants were wiped out by the Saracens before they even
reached Jerusalem.
The nobles' armies, on the other hand, sailed and marched
from Normandy, Flanders, southern France, and Sicily, led by
their dukes and counts, and by the Bishop of Le Puy as the Papal
Legate. The armies gathered before the gates of Nicaea, which
they took by siege, then engaged the Turks at Dorylaeum, and
decisively beat the pagans.
Numerous other cities and towns surrendered or were
besieged as well, until the crusaders arrived before Jerusalem in
1099.

bohemont

There they settled in for a siege, which lasted several
months. The crusaders used the Holy Lance, which they had
found at Antioch, as their standard, parading around the city
with it at the head of their army. Ultimately the walls of
Jerusalem were stormed, and many inhabitants slaughtered.
Saracens were killed by being shot or pushed off the walls, and
a large number of Jews were herded into a synagogue which was
then set afire. Indeed, the Tomb of the Holy Sepulcher ran thigh
deep in blood.
After the First Crusade a number of Latin states were
created in the Holy Land. The Kingdom of Jerusalem, the most
important state, was held by Godfrey of Bouillon, the leader of
the army of Flanders. Other states included the County of
Edessa, the County of Tripoli, and the Principality of Antioch.
The survival of these new lands was greatly aided by fighting

between the Seljuk Turks and the Fatimid Empire of Egypt.
Many knights stayed behind to protect their new lands, and
various Christian military orders were organized at this time.


Second Crusade
The fall of the Latin kingdom of Edessa, founded after the
First Crusade, to the forces of Islam in A.D. 1144 spread fear
and dismay among the lords and princes of the other Holy Land
kingdoms. The lords appealed to Pope Eugenius IIl for aid in
the fight to preserve their lands. The Pope appointed Bernard
of Clairveaux, a charismatic preacher, later to become St.
Bernard, to preach the Crusade among the lords of Mythic
Europe.
Bernard went to Louis VIl of France, and enjoined him to
lead the Crusade. In 1146, at Vezelay, with the French King by
his side, Bernard preached the Crusade to assembled nobles,
who joined en masse.
Bernard then proceeded to Germany, where he enlisted
the Emperor Conrad Ill, and a multitude of German knights.
Even before the German crusaders left their lands, though, they
set upon Jews at the instigation of Peter, Abbot of Cluny, and
Rodolphe, a French monk in Germany.
For his part Louis
levied heavy taxes on the Jews of France, but refrained from
attacking them. The Germans, however, attacked the Jewish
quarters of many cities, committing atrocities against all Jews.
At Speyer, a Jewess was tortured on the rack to make her

convert to Christianity. At Mainz the crusaders chased a group
of Jews into the house of the Bishop, and killed the Jews before
the Bishop's eyes. Such violence was only a taste of that to come.
The Germans started their march to the Holy Land on
Easter day, 1147. The French set out on Pentecost. The young
Eleanor of Aquitaine even traveled with her husband Louis,
accompanied by a number of noble-born ladies in waiting.
Eleanor and her ladies formed a company of their own, and
rode as Amazon warriors, with their breasts uncovered. The
sight of these ladies amused the Byzantines, but the armored
knights in the crusading army made more than one town's
menfolk turn their gaze.
The French and Germans continued their assault and
sacked many towns in Byzantium. Some nobles went so far as
to urge their kings to take Constantinople. The kings did not,
but seeds were sown which would lead to the sack of
Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade.
Though they began the Crusade separately, the Germans
and French faced the same fate in the Holy War. The Germans
insisted on following the trail of the First Crusade, but waterless
wastes and Muslim raids slowed their advance. At Dorylaeum,
where the army of the First Crusade won a magnificent victory,
the Saracens fell upon the Germans and wreaked such havoc
that scarcely one knight in ten remained
The French, spurred on by false reports of a German
victory, rushed towards Dorylaeum, but were stopped by the
wastes and Saracens. The crusading armies retreated to the
coast, where they attempted to book passage to Antioch. The
sailing masters demanded heavy fees, though, so only kings, a
few lords with their retainers, and ladies were able to escape to
Antioch. The remainder of the armies were overtaken by the
Saracens and slain to a man.
In the meantime, the monarchs and their few followers
continued to Jerusalem, where King Baldwin III joined his men
with the arrivals and marched against Damascus. Divided
command, and dissension between kings as to who should rule
a fallen Damascus robbed the siege of its purpose. When word
arrived that a Muslim army was approaching to lift the siege, the
Christian army virtually disintegrated, fleeing back to Jerusa-
lem, Antioch, and Acre. Emperor Conrad returned to Germany
a broken man. King Louis traveled the Holy Land for a year,
making pilgrimage to the holy shrines. King Baldwin retired to
Jerusalem and saw to his defenses. The Second Crusade had
won nothing.
Third Crusade
In the forty years between the Second and Third Crusades,
the Latins living in the Holy Land took on many aspects of the
Muslims, especially in dress and manner. The two cultures
mingled, much as Sicily and Spain had mingled, producing an
atmosphere of mutual tolerance. Truces and pacts were made
between the Saracens and Christians, but a few Christians,
especially the orders of Templars and Hospitallers and the
Prince of Antioch, repeatedly broke the peace.

Finally Reginald de Chatillon, Prince of Antioch, captured'
a caravan containing the sister of Saladin, Emir of Egypt and
Syria. Saladin then led his troops in a Jihad (Arabic, "Holy
War") against the Latin kingdoms. He defeated the Latin army
at the battle of Hattin in A.D. 1187 and killed Reginald with his
own hands. Furthermore, he captured Acre, and besieged
Jerusalem, capturing it in twelve days. However, as evidence of
his leniency, Saladin released soldiers captured at Hattin, but
required of them an oath never again to bear arms against him.
The soldiers were later absolved of their oaths by the Church.
In the meantime, William, Archbishop of Tyre, traveled to
Italy, France, and Germany, telling of the fall of Jerusalem.
**Frederick Barbarossa, Emperor of the Germans; Richard
Lionheart, King of England; and Philip Augustus, King of
France journeyed** to the Holy Lands by separate routes
Frederick, lauded as the new Moses who would show the way
to the Promised Land, drowned in a river in the Kingdom of
Little Minor in 1190. The Germans elected to continue on, to
besiege Acre, leaderless and but a small part of the army which
had left Germany the year before.
Richard and Philip rendezvoused in Sicily, where King
Tancred offended Richard. In turn Richard seized Messina and
sold it back for 40,000 ounces of gold. Richard could then
afford passage for his men to the Holy land. Unfortunately a
number of Richard's ships were wrecked on the coast of
Cyprus, and his men were abused by the islanders. To rectify
matters Richard mad a quick conquest of the island in 1191,
and gave it to Guy of Lusignan, the now homeless King of
Jerusalem.
The French King Philip had preceded Richard, and had
joined the Germans in their siege of Acre. The city surrendered
a few weeks after Richard also arrived, with his men. It was then
that Philip became ill with fever, and went home to France,
leaving Richard as sole leader of the Crusade.
The campaign between Richard and Saladin was an un-
usual one. Where they might exchange blows one week, they
exchanged courtesies the next. Numerous treaties and bar-
gains were arranged between the two leaders, but most were
broken, often by the Christians. Finally, Richard, ill and tired
of the unending war, left for home.
As a consequence of his respect for the enemy, and the
treacherousness of the Christians, Saladin, though a Saracen,
came to be seen as the personification of Christian virtues. The
Third Crusade attributed him with being gentle to the weak,
merciful to the vanquished, generous to the poor, and faithful
to his word. Ironic that a war initiated to eliminate pagans
actually venerated them.

Fourth Crusade
The Third Crusade had saved Acre and Antioch, but left
Jerusalem in Muslim hands. Pope Innocent III demanded
another crusade, but the kings he preached to were less than
eager. Philip of France had had enough of crusades and
Emperor Frederick Il was a boy of four. Richard of England
replied: "You advise me to dismiss my three daughters: pride,

avarice and incontinence. I bequeath them to the most deserving,
my pride to the Templars, my avarice to the monks of Citeaux, and
my incontinence to the prelates.
Innocent persisted, however, and put forward a plan to
attack Egypt, which would enable Italian fleets to sail the
eastern Mediterranean unhindered by Saracens. Venice agreed
to ship an army for 85,000 marks of silver and one-half the
spoils of the campaign. But, Enrico Dandalo, Doge of Venice,
had no intention of attacking Egypt, to which Venice imported
timber, iron, and weapons in return for slaves, which were sold
in Constantinople and other north African cities.
Now in the Thirteenth Century, while the crusaders
haggle for passage to Egypt, the Doge enters into a secret
agreement with the Egyptians to divert the Crusade. In 1202
the armies gather in Venice, led by Marquis Boniface of
Montferrat, Count Baldwin of Flanders, Count Louis of Blois,
and Simon de Montfort, who will lead the Albigensian Crusade.
The crusaders are able to raise 51,000 marks, short of the
agreed price. Enrico Dandalo proposes to forgive the oversight
if the crusaders capture the town of Zara, Hungary's port on the
Adriatic. Pope Innocent threatens to excommunicate anyone
who takes part in the attack, but is ignored. The army takes Zara
in five days, dividing the spoils. The Pope carries out his threat,
excommunicating the crusaders and the Venetians. The cru-
saders beg mercy of the Pope for their transgression. He grants
it, but demands that they return the booty taken from Zara. The
crusaders obey, but the Venetians ignore the Pope.
The Crusade then suffers another deviation from its in
tended course. Isaac Il Angelus, Emperor of Byzantium, had
been deposed, blinded, and imprisoned in 1195 by his brother,
Alexius III. Isaac's son, also named Alexius, fled to Germany
and then to Venice, where he became the guest of the Venetian
Dandalo. In 1202 the younger Alexius approaches the crusad-
ers, pledging to raise money and men to aid the crusaders, and
to make the eastern Church subservient to Rome if the crusad-
ers help restore his father to the throne. The Pope again
threatens excommunication, this time against anyone who
attacks Byzantium, but again his threats have little effect.
In 1202 the crusading army sets sails, in 480 Venetian
ships, ready to plunder the richest city in the east. They land
before Constantinople in 1203, after various delays en route.
The invaders capture the city in the face of feeble opposition,
and place Isaac back on the throne, crowning his son Alexius
IV, after making sure Isaac abides by the agreements his son had
made.
However, the people of the city, led by its priests, rebel
against the conquerors. In the fighting that follows a fire is lit
that ravages the city for eight days, burning a considerable
portion of Constantinople to the ground. Furthermore, a
prince of blood kills Alexius IV, reimprisons Isaac, and takes
the throne as Alexius V Ducas. The crusaders retaliate by
besieging the city, and when it surrenders after a month, loot
it thoroughly, even stripping the churches of their plate and
relics, which are later sold in the west.

The Venetians, who had been trading in Constantinople
for centuries, take the finest goods, including four horses they
once placed over the Piazza de San Marcos. After the looting
and pillaging is over, the Latins chose Baldwin of Flanders to
head the Empire of Romania, and the Byzantine territories are
divided up among other western leaders. Venice also takes part
of Constantinople, many of the Ionian islands, and a number of
harbors in Greece. The Pope even accepts the return of the
Orthodox branch of the Church to the Catholic fold, so lasting
does the reunification of east and west seem to be.
Not all Byzantine nobles are defeated by the crusaders,
though. A number of princes flee to the countryside, founding
rival empires to match their lost one. The Empire of Trebizond
flourishes along the coast of the Black Sea, under the rule of
Alexius Comnenus. Michael Angelus founds the Despotate of
Epirus. And, Theodore Lascaris founds the Empire of Nicaea,
which eventually retakes Constantinople in 126l.
It must also be said that though most crusaders are lured
by wealth and plunder from their original destination, a few
actually continue on to the Holy Land. But, they are unable to
accomplish much against the Saracens.


Children's Crusade
In A.D. 1212 two children, Nicholas, a German appren-
tice, and Stephen, a French shepherd, are said hear the voice of
Christ calling them. Christ calls them to lead the children of
Christendom to the Holy Land, to retake the Holy Sepulcher.
Nicholas leads 30,000 children, mostly from the area around
Cologne, on a journey across the Alps to Genoa, where mer-
chants laugh at their requests to be taken to the Holy Land with
no means of payment. Undaunted, Nicholas appeals to Pope
Innocent III for aid, but even the Pope gently tells him to go
home. Disconsolate, Nicholas leads many children back over
the Alps, but several thousand remain in Genoa, becoming
apprentices and seamen.
The Crusade led by Stephen comes to a more terrible end.
He leads 20,000 children to **Marseille**, where he promises God
will part the sea, allowing them to walk to Jerusalem. The sea
refuses to part, but a number of merchants offer the children
free passage to the Holy Land. Instead of taking them to
Jerusalem, the merchants sail south to the coast of Africa, where
they sell the children to the Muslims as slaves.
When German Emperor Frederick II hears of the atrocity
he has all the merchants involved hanged for their crimes. The
Pope excommunicates them as well, darning them to eternal
torment.
As a result of this scandal, the city of Marseille
acquires an unsavory reputation, making honest merchants
shun the city.


fifth Crusade
Innocent Ill, horrified at the outcome of the Fourth
Crusade, calls for a new crusade at the Church's Lateran
Council of A.D. 1215. Innocent III again calls for the invasion
of Egypt, giving the Christians a base from which to attack
Jerusalem, and denying it to the Saracens.
In 1217 king Andrew of Hungary leads a combined force
of Hungarians, Germans, and Bohemians south, attacking the
city of Damietta. Francis of Assisi comes with the army, but is
horrified by the slaughter when the crusaders take the city in
1218.
The Sultan of Egypt offers terms for peace, which include
the return of the True Cross, lost when Saladin took Jerusalem,
and the return of all Christian prisoners and slaves. Even
though these terms would make the Crusade the most success-
ful since the First, the crusaders demand a large indemnity,
desiring money more than the return of the Holy Land.
The war therefore continues, with Saracens whittling away
at Christian forces until the crusaders accept peace terms in
1221, returning Damietta to the Egyptians in exchange for the
True Cross. The crusaders blame their diminished victory on
the German Emperor Frederick Il, who had taken crusading
vows in 1215, but did not join the Crusade because of political
difficulties in Italy.


Sixth Crusade
In A.D. 1228 Emperor Frederick Il finally sets out on
crusade, fulfilling the vow he made in 1215. Though he fulfills
his commitment he is shunned by the Christians still in the
Holy Land as he is still under excommunication (for not
participating in the Fifth Crusade).
After fighting for part of a year Frederick sends messengers
to the Sultan of Egypt, finally concluding a peace in 1229. The
Sultan requests a truce for ten years and ten months. In return
he relinquishes most coastal cities to the Christians, and all of
Jerusalem, excluding the Dome of the Rock (though Christians
are allowed inside the Dome of the Rock to pray at the site of
Solomon's temple). Another term of the agreement is the
release of all prisoners on both sides.
Christians in the Holy Land rejoice at the terms, but Pope
Gregory IX declares the treaty an insult to Christendom, and
refuses to ratify it. Frederick remains in the Holy Land for a few
more years, and then departs for Germany.
After Frederick's departure the Christian nobility in the
Holy Land seize Jerusalem, and ally with the Emir of Damascus
against the Sultan of Egypt. In turn, the Sultan calls on the
Turks, who capture Jerusalem in 1244, slaughtering thousands
of inhabitants and enslaving thousands more. Pope Innocent
IV, succeeding Gregory, calls for a crusade against Frederick,
offering the same indulgences and privileges for the crusade as
if the enemy is Muslim. However, most lords refuse to join a
crusade against a Catholic monarch, the memory of the horrific
Albigensian Crusade still fresh in their minds.

Seventh Crusade
Shortly after the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 1244 Louis IX of
France organizes a crusade to attack Egypt. He also labors to
heal the breach between Frederick Il and Innocent IV, so that
a united Mythic Europe might support the Crusade. Instead of
forgiving Frederick, Innocent sends a messenger, **Giovanni de
Piano Carpini**, to the Great Khan in Asia, offering an alliance to
destroy the Muslims. The reply which comes back, several
years later, is that Mythic Europe must first submit to Mongol
rule.
In 1248 Louis sets out on the Crusade, accompanied by
many of the great lords of France.
The crusaders reached
Damietta, besieging and taking the town quickly. However, the
Nile floods rise, cutting off the city for half a year. Waiting out
the floods, the nobles entertain themselves with feasts, tourna-
ments, and debauchery, so that when the army leaves Damietta,
it is undisciplined and slothful.
Not surprisingly, the Sultan of Egypt routes the French at
the Battle of Mansura, capturing 10,000 Frenchmen, including
the King, who is ill with the flux (dysentery). The Sultan lends
his own physician to the King, who recovers in a month. The
Sultan demands 500,000 lives ransom, but reduces his de-
mand to 50,000 when the French King accepts the Sultans
extravagant terms.

Louis pays half of the ransom, and is released on the
promise that he will pay the other half. Instead Louis leads the
remnants of his army to Acre, where they stay for four years.
Louis also sends a messenger, William of Rubriquois, to the
Great Khan, hoping for an alliance of his own, but William
returns with a message similar to that of Giovanni de Piano
Carpini. Louis returns to France in 1254.
After Louis leaves the Holy Land, factions which had been
quiet during his stay resume their activities. In 1256 a war
between Genoese and Venetians in the ports of the Holy Land
erupts, eventually dragging all other factions into the conflict.
Taking advantage of the chaos, Baybars, Sultan of Egypt,
sweeps up the coast of the Holy Land, capturing many cities. In
fact, **Antioch is pillaged and burned so badly that it never
recovers, fading into history after 1268.**

Eighth Crusade
King Louis of France takes to the cross a second time in
A.D. 1267, but the nobility of France refuses to support him. He
therefore leads only a small army to Tunis, where he hopes to
split the coast of North Africa, allowing Christians to attack
both Morocco and Egypt. No sooner does the army land than
Louis again falls ill of the flux, but this time dies. Ironically,
much of his army dies as well, and his sons give up the Crusade
and return to France.
This is the last Crusade against the Muslims of the Holy
Land, though a few skirmishes are still staged. In 1291 a band
of Christian adventurers in the Holy Land attacks a Muslim
caravan. The Sultan of Egypt demands compensation, which
is not paid. **The Sultan then attacks Acre, the strongest
Christian stronghold left in the Holy Land, taking it in only
forty-three days.** The Sultan allows his men their freedom of
the town, and they massacre or enslave 60,000 prisoners. The
remaining Christian cities of the Holy Land surrender or are
captured soon afterwards, eliminating Latin occupation of the
Holy Land for all time.

Albigensian Crusade
The heretical Albigensian religious sect, centered in the
County of **Toulouse**, is a constant thorn in the side of the
Church. The movement's followers preach Apostolic poverty
in the Church, and that salvation is only available to those who
have no worldly possessions. Paradoxically, the Albigensians
are supported by great nobles, renowned for their extrava-
gance. Even Count Raymond of Toulouse hosts Perfecti and
believers, and is on the verge of joining the movement when
Pope Innocent III initiates the chain of events which lead to the
Albigensian Crusade.
The Pope's first reaction to the Albigensians is not a
crusade, though. Rather, he sends the Cistercian order to
Toulouse to reform the Albigensians. However, the Albigensians
only gain support by using the Cistercians, contrasting their
humility and poverty to the wealth and pomp of the monks.
Thus, the Albigensians continue their so-called heretical faith.


Next, in 1205, the Pope appoints three legates-Peter of
Castlenau, Raynarde de Certre, and Arnold-Amalric to
Toulouse. Their mission is to extirpate the heretics. The legates
are empowered by the Pope to call on the King of France for aid
but are enjoined to use moderation. The legates excommuni-
cate Count Raymond and put his lands under interdict. As a
result local animosity toward the Church intensifies, until, in
1208, the hated Peter of Castlenau is murdered by one of the
Count's knights. This events makes war an inevitability, and
the Pope calls a crusade against the Albigensians.
At the time of heretical activity, King Philip Il Augustus of
France is involved in a war against the English, and has no time
for a campaign in southern France. Nevertheless, many lords
and knights, hungry for lands of the south and for absolution
of sin, assemble at Lyon in 1209. This army, led by Simon de
Montfort, takes southern city after city, ravaging and laying
waste to the land.
In reaction to the Crusade King Peter Il of Aragon,
overlord of Foix and Beziers, protests to the Pope about the
attacks on his lands, but his pleas are ignored. Consequently,
Peter takes the field against the crusaders, leading his own army
north. The Spanish and French armies clash at the battle of
Muret in 1213, where Peter of Aragon is killed. Simon de
Montfort is granted the titles of Count of Toulouse and Duke
of Narbonne by the Pope in 1215.
After the death of Innocent III in 1216, King Philip takes
his turn at crusading. He had promised to crusade against the
Saracens in the Holy Land, but at the time has not fulfilled that
vow. Instead, he crusades in his own lands. In the meantime
the Albigensians rally and Toulouse rebels against de Montfort,
who is killed in 1218 while trying to retake his lands. King
Philip tries to take Toulouse as well, but returns north when his
efforts fail.
Philip dies in 1223, and King Louis VIll takes to the field
in 1226, defeating Provence. The heretics still hold out in
Toulouse, though, under Raymond VI, son of Raymond VI.
Raymond VIl continues the struggle of his faith, leading a
league of southern lords against the northern armies. Unfortu-
nately the southern league is defeated, and their lands ravaged
once again.
The rebels finally yield, signing the Treaty of Paris in April
1229, bringing some peace to southern France. The fall of
castle Montsegur, in 1244, is the last great event of the Crusade,
wherein two hundred castle defenders are dragged from their
retreats and burned by the Crusaders.
**Though the Albigensian Crusade is ostensibly a victory for
the Church, the cultures of Provençe and Aquitaine are de-
stroyed by the struggle. No longer do the lands' unique
troubadours sing of the courts of love**. In fact, many cities, as
cultural centers, are so badly damaged they never recover. The
old noble families are also displaced. New lords, with northern
ideas and allegiances, take control of the countryside, over.
whelming the former character of the land

Though he is loathe to admit it, the fury of the northern
crusaders takes even the Pope by surprise. Not even he is able
to control the knights once loosed, not even to save the culture
of a land once occupied by genuinely devout Catholics.


Reconquista
The reconquest of Spain (from the Muslims who had
captured parts of it in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries) started
in the early Eleventh Century. The reclamation was initiated
when the Omayyad Caliphate of Cordova dissolved into a
group of small, mutually hostile Islamic kingdoms, known as
Taifas. Each Taifa was based on a city, though some controlled
no more than two or three towns. The Christian kingdoms of
northern Spain, which were not much more politically ad-
vanced, had a number of strong kings who were able to take
advantage of the disarray of the Moorish forces to capture the
occupied territory and return it to Christian rule.
By A.D. 1090, the border between Muslim and Christian
lands had been pushed down to a line from Coimbra to Toledo,
then north to the southern border of Aragon. The most famous
Christian of this period was not a king or great noble, but a
knight named **Rodrigo de Vivar**, more commonly known by the
name his Moorish enemies gave him, **El Cid**.
The Spanish Muslims were not without aid against the
Christians and El Cid, though. In Africa, a fundamentalist sect
of Muslims known as the Almoravids had established an
empire stretching across the northern coast of Africa, east of
Tangier almost to Barce. The kings of the Taifas begged the
Almoravids to aid them against the Christians, which they did,
twice defeating the Christian armies. The Almoravids soon
grew just as decadent as the Taifas they supported, though, and
lost their holdings in Africa to a new sect, the Almohads, who
were even more fanatical than the Almoravids had been. The
Almohads fought the Almoravids for southern Spain, finally
uniting it in 1175.

THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY
Dynastic problems among the Christian kings in the
Thirteenth Century keep them from unifying to expel the
Moors from Spain, though some advances are made. The final
stage of the reconquest begins in A.D. 1210, when Pope
Innocent III declares a crusade against the Moors (partially to
redirect marauding knights engaged in the Albigensian Crusade). 
In the Spanish Crusade Alfonso VIII of Castile leads a
united Spanish army from Toledo, in 1212, and routes the
Almohads at the battle of **Los Navas de Tolosa**. The Almohads
never recover from the defeat, and their downfall becomes
inevitable.
Though, further dynastic struggles in the Christian states
allow the Muslims more time to recoup, they cannot resist
further Christian attacks. **The Almohad Empire breaks up into
petty kingdoms in 1223, of which Cordova is the greatest.**
Castile captures Cordova in 1236, Seville in 1248, and Murcia
in 1261. Meanwhile, Aragon captures the Balearic Isles in 1235,
and Valencia in 1238. Portugal conquers the territory east of
Silves, to the Guadiana river, where the forces of Castile move
westward. This area between the two armies, the Algarve, is
finally acknowledged as Portuguese territory in 1267. Only the
Muslim kingdom of Granada holds out against the feuding
Christian states.

Mongols
The latest in a long series of eastern steppe nomads, the
Mongols appear in Thirteenth Century western Mythic Europe
in A.D. 1222, when they come off the steppes and capture the
city of Tana on the Black Sea.
The Mongols are a race of hardy horsemen, afraid of
nothing and capable of hideous acts of cruelty, both as a people,
and individually. The Mongols begin riding as soon as they can
remain seated on a horse, and learn the use of the bow as soon
as they can pull the string.
Led by their kings, known as khans, the Mongols capture
town after town around the Black Sea in 1222 and 1223, then
disappear back into the steppe until 1237, when they begin
attacking cities in Russia. During their western invasion the
Mongols defeat everyone in their path. **They forge through to
Poland, sacking Cracow, and defeating the combined armies of
Teutonic knights, Poles, and German Imperial forces at the
Battle of Leignitz**. They continue with the sack of Olmutz, and
pass through Hungary on their way back to the steppes. Once
established in Russia, the Golden Horde, as the Mongols call
themselves, take control of the government.
No one knows why the Mongols disappear from Mythic
Europe in 1223, or why they turn back from further invasions
in 1241. Speculation on the subject runs from the power of
Christian prayer and miracle which drives off the heathens, to
the summoning of demons which lay waste to the barbarians.


Denmark
The inhabitants of Denmark have always been warriors.
During the age of Viking raids, **the Danes made England and
France their hunting grounds, while the Swedes attacked
Russia and Poland, and the Norwegians sailed to Scotland and
Ireland**. The Danes settled in England in an area known as the
Danelaw, and received danegeld, or ransom, to keep them from
ravaging the lands of the Angles and Saxons. It was King Gorm
who conquered the jarls (earls) and united Denmark, while his
son, Harald Bluetooth, converted the pagan Danes to Christian-
ity by fire and sword.
In A.D. 1002 King Ethelred the Unredy of England mur-
dered the Danes in his service, including the sister of King Svein
of Denmark. Svein thus became the mortal enemy of Ethelred,
and attacked England for ten years, attacks against which the
English had no defense. Svein finally chased Ethelred to
Normandy in 1013, and took over the country, but suddenly
died in 1014.
On their father's death, Svein's son Harald Il took the
crown of Denmark, while his other son, Canute, sailed to
England to assume the throne there. Harald died in 1019,
whereupon Canute sailed to Denmark, uniting the two king-
doms of Denmark and England once again. Canute conquered
Norway in 1028, but the kingdom revolts against Denmark in
1234.
Canute's death in 1035 left his son Hardicanute with a
rebellion in Norway, while his other son Harold Harefoot was
crowned by the English. Hardicanute invaded England in
1040, and his brother died of mysterious circumstances just as
Hardicanute's fleet appeared off the coast. Hardicanute there-
fore ruled both England and Denmark, but with an iron fist and
was hated in both countries. Hardicanute's death in 1042
allowed the English to return to their own kings, while Den-
mark was plunged into civil war.
After Hardicanute, Denmark floundered for more than a
century while the jarls fought the king and each other. That was
the case until the reign of King Valdemer, who seized the crown
through battle and murder. He reorganized the government,
encouraged trade, and swept the seas and islands of the pirates
that infested them. **Valdemer's minister, Absalon, Archbishop
of Lund, made many of the King's accomplishments possible,
and founded the city of Copenhagen ("Market-haven") in 1167
for traders traveling from the south**. Even the Danish Church
flourished under Valdemer and Absalon, and Denmark slowly
grew into feudalism. Indeed, non-noble peasants became
tenant farmers, while a new class of knights grew to provide the
army of the realm with a ready source of manpower. And the
peasants, instead of providing soldiery, were taxed instead.

Thirteenth Century
The Danish kings take advantage of Henry the Lion and the
civil wars in the Holy Roman Empire to expand to the south and
east along the Baltic coast. However, their effort to control the
Baltic is foiled at the Battle of Bornhovede in 1227, when
Valdemer Il is captured by Imperial forces.
Trade also improves in Thirteenth Century Denmark.
This commercial growth arises as the population of the king.-
dom clears forests and settles islands instead of staging raids
like the Vikings of the past. Monetary concerns become so
important in Denmark that the Church and nobility begin to
limit the power of the King, especially in the levying of taxes on
land. And, these trade concerns lead to more political ones. In
1282 Danish nobles force King Eric V to sign a charter prom-
ising to summon a council of nobles once a year, and not to
punish without due process of law. So emphatic are the nobility
in their demands that Eric is murdered in 1286 when he reneges
on the charter. Learning from his predecessor's error, Eric VI
realizes it is in his best interests to abide by the charter, and rules
wisely thereafter.

AARHUSE
Aarhuse was made a bishopric in A.D. 950, and was a base
from which Frankish missionaries spread the word of God to
the Danes. In 985 King Svein Forkbeard granted the cathedral
of Aarhuse jurisdiction over the city.
For a short while priests from Aarhuse rode the waves with
the sea raiders, but the Bishop declared the murder and pillage
of fellow Christians to be against the law of God and man. The
matter was tested in 1003, when Thorkeld Strongjaw led a force
of five ships raiding along the coast of France, returning laden
with plunder. The Bishop forbade the raiders to land, and
declared them excommunicate and outlawed. The prospect of
that much treasure, possessed by one whose fate had been
determined by the Church, was too much to resist for sailors up
and down the coast. Thorkeld was attacked numerous times,
losing all but one ship, and losing all his treasure. He returned
to Aarhuse and begged forgiveness of the Bishop. It was
granted, but Thorkeld was commanded to join the Benedictine
order. He did so, and lived out his days in a monastery.
The citizens of Aarhuse continue to follow the lead of their
Bishop, who is the overlord of the city. Aarhuse still produces
great sailors, but they have joined the Hanseatic League, and no
longer plunder the coasts of France and England as their
forefathers did.

BORGLUM
When the families who lived in the village of Borglum
resisted the religious conversion of the kingdom under Svein
Forkbeard in A.D. 987, the King had the entire region swept by
his troops, killing every person found, from the youngest child

to the eldest grandmother. Forkbeard then resettled the area
with southern Swedes and constructed a church, the dedica-
tion of which he personally oversaw.
Borglum is now one of the most loyal towns of the
kingdom, supporting the King with money and warriors. The
city is also one of the most fervent in its faith. The people of
Borglum are required to search their city for heretics and
pagans, a duty passed from generation to generation.
A church is built into each gate of the city. Visitors are only
allowed in at specified times and must attend Mass before
proceeding into the city. Horses and livestock are not allowed
in the city; stables and stockyards are provided outside the
walls.

MALMO
Founded in A.D. 1203 by Hanseatic shippers, Malmo
begins as a quiet village with a moderately good harbor. The
League, needing a safe port in which to trade with the southern
Swedes, buys the land on which the town stands, and imports
masons and laborers from Germany to undertake the construc-
tion.
**The town's church, built of wood, burns to the ground
during its dedication ceremony in 1207. Rebuilt of stone, the
church develops great cracks in its walls, making it unsafe for
services. An old man comes forward then and declares the
church is haunted by a draug, an undead creature over whose
tomb the church is built. Christian ceremonies to exorcise or
lay the draug to rest prove futile. Eventually, in 1246, the
building is abandoned and a new church is constructed a safe
distance from the old one.**

RIBE
Established as a bishopric in A.D. 948 by King Harold
Bluetooth, Ribe is a center of Danish trade, peopled by fearless
descendents of Viking raiders. The seamen of Ribe boast they
are afraid of neither storm nor tide, not even the terrible tides
which sweep from the Atlantic to the Baltic.
Ribe has maintained its distance from the Hanseatic League,
and its people travel where they wish. As the city has its own
ships, a blockade by the League means little. In 1205 a blockade
is attempted by Hamburg, against the advice of the League. The
sailors of Ribe show that their veneer of civilization, lent by
Christianity, is thin. They reveal that beneath their Christianity
lies the Viking and the berserk. In a two hour battle the fierce
Danes sink or capture all but one of the blockading ships. The
Bishop of Ribe has to personally intervene to prevent the
sacrifice of captured sailors.
Though the country of Ribe is Christian, the surrounding
lands belong to the wizards of the Order of Odin, who keep
Magi of the Order of Hermes at bay.





Russia
The principalities of Russia are located at the beginning of
a boundless sea of grass, the steppes, which stretches all the way
to fabled Cathay. The steppes are home to fierce nomads, of
which the Mongols are but the latest wave. Huns, Magyars,
Bulgars, and Mongols all rode off the steppes and into the
history of Mythic Europe.
Northern Russia is divided into sixty-four principalities,
founded by Viking traders seeking the markets of Mickleburg
(Constantinople), by following the great rivers south. The
trading posts they founded grew into cities, and the cities
became the nuclei of the principalities.
The Prince of Kiev is acknowledged by most other Russian
princes as the first among equals. At his death in A.D. 1054 the
then Grand Prince of Kiev, Yaroslav, divided the principalities
among his sons, the eldest inheriting Kiev, the others assigned
principalities based on their birth. A system was then set up
whereby a prince would move from a lesser to a greater
principality upon the death of a senior prince. The system is
still used in the Thirteenth Century. Princes were and are
responsible to the council of nobles, and to the popular
assembly. The Church also became responsible for administra-
tion and law, and now holds a near monopoly on literacy. Only
a few Russian traders and nobles bother to learn or read.
Finally, under the new system of administration, the keeping
of slaves was accepted, and fell under the jurisdiction of the
Church.
Between the death of Grand Prince Yaroslav and the
Mongol invasions in 1224, there were eighty-three civil wars,
293 princes in sixty-four principalities, and sixteen wars by
Russian princes against foes outside the country. By 1113 the
poverty caused by war, unemployment, high interest rates, and
chronic exploitation by the nobles had reached its peak in Kiev.
The peasants and townsfolk rose in revolt, killing nobles,
moneylenders, and churchmen, and took over the government
for a short time. The remaining nobles called on Prince
Monomakh of Pereyaslaval to become the Grand Prince of
Kiev, over his protestations. Once he held the throne, he cut the


rate of interest on loans, reduced the authority of employers
over the employed, and restricted the selling of bankrupt
debtors into slavery. The nobles screamed the new Grand
Prince overstepped his bounds, while the poor complained he
did not do enough
Given the country's internal turmoil, the Russian martial
spirit was not up to the task of defending the Motherland. This
was true even in 1096, when raids by Bulgars in the south
enslaved entire villages. Kiev itself was sacked in 1169 by a rival
prince. And, the rise of the Italian trade cities in the Mediterranean
cut off trade which had sustained Russia.

Thirteenth Century
The final blow is delivered to Russia by the Mongols, who
sack and burn most major cities, enslaving thousands of
peasants, and replacing ruling nobles with khans.
The Mongols come up from the south in the 1220s,
attacking the Cuman tribes along the shores of the Black Sea.
The Cumans, hereditary enemies of the principalities, ask the
Russians for aid, saying
"The Mongols have taken our lands
today, tomorrow they will take yours." Several princes lead their
troops south and join with the Cumans, but the combined
armies are defeated by the Mongols near the sea of Azov.
The Mongols then retreat back to the steppes, only to
return in A.D. 1237 under Batu Khan, who has an army of
500,000 ferocious horsemen. The Mongols sweep through the
principalities like wildfire through dry grass, burning cities and
pillaging as they come. Kiev is sacked in 1238, and when the
monk Giavanno de Piano Carpini sees the ruined town in 1244,
he describes it as "two hundred cottages surrounded by fields of
skulls."
The Mongols then pass to the west, overrunning
Poland and Hungary, and returning to Russia where they stay,
calling themselves the Golden Horde. Russian nobles are
allowed to keep their lands, but at the cost of a crushing tribute
and sometimes yearly visits to the Khan of the Golden Horde,
or even to the Great Khan in Mongolia.
The Mongols, knowing that they cannot hold the land
against the Russians and all outside threat, make alliances with
Constantinople, and protect the lives and property of the
Orthodox Church. Thus, to gain a level of security, thousands
of Russians join the ranks of Orthodox monks, and others give
generously to the Church, which becomes wealthy amid the
general squalor of Russian towns
KIEV
Kiev was founded by Viking traders, who discovered the
markets of Constantinople by following Russian rivers south
ward. Kiev was a trading post and fort, providing protection

and markets for Norse merchants. From these humble begin-
nings grew a large city, which became the capital of the premier
principality in Russia.
In A.D. 1113, the peasants threw off the rule of the nobles
and seized the city, protesting chronic unemployment and debt
caused by decades of warfare. The nobles of Kiev called upon
Prince Monomakh of Pereyaslaval to become the Grand Prince
of Kiev, which he reluctantly did. Once in power Monomakh
made sweeping reforms, which satisfied neither the nobles,
who saw them as too strict, nor the poor, who saw them as too
slack. Prince Monomakh died after twelve years of trying to
mend the problems of Kiev and the rest of Russia.
The Prince of Suzdalia, another Russian principality, sacked
the city in 1169, selling thousands of its citizens as slaves. Kiev
has barely recovered from the attack when, in 1237, the
Mongols come off the steppes and burn the city to the ground,
again enslaving the people of Kiev. Once regarded as the
"Mother of Russian cities," Kiev is now a sad little town; barely
two hundred cottages make up the center of town, and the
fields for miles around are filled with skulls and bones.

VLADIMIR
Founded by King Vladimir I in A.D. 987, Vladimir was the
seat of the Prince of Vladimir, who was nominally subservient
to the Prince of Kiev.
Vladimir trades grain and timber to Poland for goods from
the west. The city is sacked by the Mongols in 1240, and
remains under the rule of the Golden Horde, who allow trade
to continue, taking the best items for themselves. Outside the
city is a pile of skulls, deteriorating in the Russian weather.
These are the skulls of the defenders of Vladimir, who resisted
the Mongols for three weeks. When the city fell, the defenders
were killed and their heads stacked as a reminder and warning
to the people of Vladimir. Now, no word of revolt is heard in
the streets, where the most important citizen makes way for the
lowliest soldier of the Golden Horde. Visitors to the city are
encouraged to leave as soon as possible, for the Mongols are
suspicious of foreigners, and are known to slaughter merchants
on a whim.

Serbia
A part of the Roman Empire since the Second Century
before Christ, Serbia was known as Illyricum (along the coast)
and Dacia (inland). The mountains of the interior provided
many rebels and revolutionaries with secure bases and hiding
places from which to try to overthrow the yoke of Rome. In
A.D. 1151 Stephen Nemanja managed to unite the tribes
inhabiting the highlands and threw off the control of Byzantium.
Nemanja's son, also named Stephen, is attracted to the
west and the Papacy. In return for granting rights to western
clergy, Stephen Il is accorded royal status in 1217 by Pope
Honorius Ill. However, the clergy of the country are still
predominantly Orthodox, so Stephen is crowned a second time
by his brother, St. Stava, according to Orthodox rites.
With Papal authority, Serbia's noble class forms itself
along the lines of the west, and formerly free peasants are
reduced to serfs tied to the land and bought, sold, or traded with
it. Unfortunately, Serbia has only one true city and port to
which serfs may escape, the city of Ragusaa, which is an
independent city-state, much like the northern Italian cities. In
1221 Ragussa appeals to Venice for protection against the
Despot of Epirus, allowing Venice to gain influence over the
city and Serbia. One of the major goals of the King of Serbia is
to gain control of Ragussa.
Serbia also falls under the influence of Bulgaria during the
reigns of Radoslav and Vladislav, and is overrun by Mongols in
1241. Uros I reestablishes peace in Serbia, and encourages
trade, resulting in increased growth both politically and finan-
cially. Uros II begins a campaign of expansion into Bulgaria,
and in response is offered Simone, the daughter of Emperor
Andronicus lI.
Serbia is one of the few states still expanding its borders,
and under Uros II, may prove to be a successor to Byzantium
in the Balkans.

RAGUSSA
Founded by the Greeks long before the birth of Christ,
Ragussa is currently the only port in the kingdom of Serbia. The
city retains the culture and language of the Romans, who
conquered it early in their history. And, fought over constantly
by Bulgarians, Italians, Normans, and Byzantines, Ragussa
declared itself an independent city in A.D. 1158, allied to Serbia
but paying neither fealty nor tribute.
The kings of Serbia dare not upset this important city, as
they are dependent on the goods brought to the port. In 1221,
to prevent an attack by the Despot of Epirus, Ragussa appeals
to Venice, which is delighted to send troops and ships. In return
the Venetians demand to be declared the city's overlord. The
move is resisted strongly by many of the city's common people,
but the merchants of Ragussa see this as their only chance for
survival, as Venice would surely conquer them if they refuse.
A solid core of the citizenry still hold ill will toward their
Venetian masters, and plot to restore the commune of Ragussa.
To this end, they have been in correspondence with the
Holy Roman Emperor, urging him to attack Venice.
They
figure that with Venice occupied by the forces of the Empire,
Ragussa can free itself.
