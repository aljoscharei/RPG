# FC5E15: Hiding Tactics for the Unseen Attacker

**Hiding Tactics for the Unseen Attacker**
Cover is a useful element on any battlefield. However, its usage isn’t limited to its defensive bonus.
Large pieces of cover and line of sight are useful elements to account for in combat. When combined, they allow a creature to hide behind them.
Hiding gives creatures defensive and offensive perks, making it an adaptable tactical decision.
**The Benefits of Hiding**
Hiding allows a creature to duck into the shadows and then strike the enemy when the time is right.
In doing so they'll have advantage on their first attack due to their Unseen Attacker status.
Hiding is also useful for stalling for a round or two. In doing so, a creature buys time for their allies to regroup or reposition.
It’s also a great defensive Action. **Attackers have disadvantage on creatures they cannot see** and some spells require vision of the target to be cast.
**The Mechanics of Hiding**
Previous lessons have covered the mechanics involved in hiding.
The ambush lesson reviewed the hiding and Unseen Attacker mechanics.
And the cover lesson went over line of sight.
**Using Hide**
Ranged creatures are the best at using the hide action. Their range lets them continue attacking while they seek out a hiding spot.
Their range also gives them more opportunities for using Unseen Attacker.
Melee creatures gain the same benefits when hiding. However, their short attack range means they may not be close enough to an enemy to attack.
Ergo, melee creatures should use hide as a defensive maneuver. For instance, hiding to break line of sight with the party’s wizard.
Due to this, the Dodge Action is often a better choice for melee creatures when line of sight isn't a factor.
Dodging also forces foes to make attacks against the creature at disadvantage. However, unlike hiding, it doesn't require the creature to move or make a skill check.
**Selecting a Hiding Spot**
Anything that can completely obscure a creature is a potential hiding spot. For instance, a large boulder.
Line of sight is also important for discerning a hiding spot.
A creature needs to be completely obscured from their enemy to hide. If the enemy has line of sight with them, they're not obscured.
Consider the battlefield's lighting as well. Darkness obscures vision making it easier for a creature to hide.
Some spots that might otherwise not be a viable hiding spot could become one due to the lighting.
A hiding spot should also make narrative sense. For instance, walking behind a wall in plain view of the enemy wouldn't make narrative sense.
However, ducking behind a pile of crates in a dark corner of a room does.
**The Goblin Special**
[Goblins (SRD 315)](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) are experts at hiding thanks to Nimble Escape. This trait allows goblins to take the Disengage or Hide Action as a Bonus Action.
Other creatures may have similar traits, but goblins are the most iconic example. Regardless, this section is relevant to any creature with a similar trait.
This trait allows goblins to duck in-and-out of hiding each turn while still attacking.
This gives them the Unseen Attacker perk each round they come out of hiding. And since they have a ranged attack they have tons of flexibility in target choice.
Hiding's defensive perks are also valuable since goblins have such low health. A few missed attacks will prolong the goblins' lives and give them more time to keep up the assault.
The only factor that limits this duck-and-shoot playstyle is a lack of hiding spots.
However, the dark and messy caverns of a goblin lair should have ample hiding locations for them.
**Defensive Hiding**
Hiding while en route provides extra defenses if a Dash Action isn’t enough movement to retreat.
Not only does this keep the creature safe, it also buys them some time.
On their next turn, the creature can reassess the situation and determine if they should fight or continue their retreat.
This delay is also useful when waiting for reinforcements. The creature can call out for allies, duck into hiding, and wait for an opportune time to strike.
**Example: Hiding Amongst the Rubble

**
A dilapidated building is a perfect spot for hiding. Especially at night due to the lack of lighting in these ruins.
The large pieces of stone rubble make for both cover and hiding spots.
The pillars are also potential hiding spots. Using these requires the creature to break line of sight with the enemy in a convincing manner.
**An Expert of the Shadows**
Hiding is a great way to buy some time. This allows reinforcements to arrive or ensure your safety as you retreat.
Unseen Attacker provides offensive perks for creatures when they're ready to come out of hiding, although ranged attackers have the easiest time using it.
All in all, hiding is an adaptable tactic. Its many benefits make it a viable tactic in both offensive and defensive scenarios.

**Answer Key:**
_A few possibilities_

1.  Northeastern crates
2.  Southeastern crates & barrels
3.  Behind the cauldron
4.  Behind the boulders
5.  Tip the tables over during combat

**How To Summary**

1.  Ranged attackers use cover most effectively due to the flexibility of their attack range
    1.  Dodge Action is more reliable if they don’t need to break line of sight

1.  Line of sight must be blocked
2.  Lighting may help as darkness obscures vision

1.  E.g. a creature can’t walk past the enemy and run out the door and call that hiding

1.  This and their ranged attacks let them freely hide and shoot from wherever

1.  The defensive bonuses are also useful due to their low HP

1.  Useful if the creature cannot leave the room with a Dash Action during a retreat
    1.  Wait for reinforcements
    2.  Allow their allies to regroup
    3.  Fightback if the party breaks rank
