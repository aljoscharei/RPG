### How to make a Fantasy Sandbox

Unlike a [Traveller Sandbox](http://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-to-make-traveller-sandbox.html) making a Fantasy Sandbox is less straightforward. This is because Traveller at the stellar level has a uniform geography while a fantasy setting can have any type of geography imaginable including the fantastic like lands floating on shards of a shattered world.
If talking a fantasy setting I would do the following

1.  Using one page sketch a world or continent map
2.  Label important regions
3.  Write one page of background giving no more than a handful of sentences to each region.
4.  Pick an area roughly 200 miles by 150 miles
5.  Grab a 8.5 by 11 sheet of hex paper.
6.  The scale should be so that it represents a 200 by 150 mile region
7.  Draw in mountains
8.  Draw in rivers
9.  Draw in hills using them to divide the region into distinct river valley
10.  Draw in vegetation (swamps, forests, desert, etc)
11.  Decide to place Population Locales note their race this includes social monsters
12.  Decide to place Lairs (locales tht revolves around a home of monsters)
13.  Decide to place Ruins (locales that revolves around a site)
14.  Decide to place miscellaneous locales. (anything that doesn't fit a above.
15.  Name your geography (don't forget islands)
16.  Write a Half Page background describing the region and it's history.
17.  Write a paragraph describing each named geography
18.  Write a paragraph describing each Population Locale
19.  Write a paragraph describing each Lair (you could get away with a stat block)
20.  Write a paragraph describing each Ruin
21.  Look at your notes and come up with two to four plots that ties one or more locales together. Write a paragraph or two on each.
22.  For each population locale come up with three to five encounters. They should be a sentence each.
23.  Come up with 6 to 12 general encounter for the region as a whole. Should usable in any area of the region. They are a sentence or two each.
24.  Pick the 4 or 6 most important Population locales and draw a quarter page sketch map of the settlement.
25.  Pick the starting population locale and draw a full page map of the settlement. This is the "Home Base"
26.  Use [Medieval Demographics](http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/blueroom/demog.htm) to get an a idea of how many shops are in the town. [[S John Ross Medieval Demographics Made Easy.pdf]]
27.  Pick or create 6 or 12 important buildings. Write a paragraph each.
28.  Scan your descriptions for NPCs or noted monsters. Write a two sentence about each. The first a one line with minimal stats the second one sentence. This is your roster.
29.  Pick the 12 most important NPC or Monsters
30.  Write a paragraph describing each and fully stat them.
31.  Pick the most six common encounter type. (City Guard, Border Warders, Bloody Hand, Orcs) Write a paragraph and fully stat them.
32.  Scan your description for any regional organization and write a paragraph on them. Fully stat the most common encounters involved with them.
33.  Make up a rumor chart with 10 to 20 items that feeds the players into the encounter and plots you created in above.
34.  Identify major regions and create a random encounter chart for each (monsters, wildlife and NPCs) \[Thanks Jeff I just plumb forgot\]
    

This will probably run to about 10,000 words. You can do this in about 2 weeks spending about 2 hours an evening at a 1,000 words a evening and time drawing maps. Or consider it about 24 hours of work.

    This is really helpful and organized. I’m planning on starting a campaign with a modified Keep on the Borderlands… I should give the sandbox experiment a chance :)

    Very helpful. Thanks!
    I think that I may have a project for this autumn (as I'll be away from my regular gaming group for a couple of months).

    @Tim
    First we'd have to decide what spheres of influence The Great Conley would preside over.
    And then design the priestesses' vestments.

    Since you have no other way of getting a message to you, I'll just leave it here.
    I just ran into this post, and loved the 'in detail' posts as well. I was wondering why you stopped at XI, leaving 24-34 behind?

    Just got caught in print project I will try to pick it up again soon. The main issue is the next post involves drawing maps which is a bit time consuming.

    I may have missed you discussing this - when in this process do you think about things that affect your entire setting (or at least large parts of it)? I'm thinking of things like special laws of nature (viz or ley lines, etc), religious orders, Magic guilds, gypsies, and so on.

    I really enjoyed all of these tutorials.
    I've written [a thread about using your tutorials to create planet outlines for Spelljammer games](http://www.thepiazza.org.uk/bb/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3019) over at the Spelljammer forum at The Piazza.
    I would love to see these completed, so that I could go through your entire process.
    I would also love you to make a How to make a Fantasy Sandbox book (maybe Print on Demand) so I could buy a copy. Maybe you could add a few more details and examples if you did that.

    Great outline on making a fantasy Sandbox game. I myself have created one and I discuss it in my blog, though I was going by another bloggers directions. This seems to cover everything in more detail though. Good stuff!

    I am finding this series very interesting and useful. Some bits better than others but very good overall and I will be referring to this for my next game.
    Also, bought your Wilderlands book on Lulu.com and wow, what a bargain, less than a penny a page, not many roleplaying products are such a deal these days! Plus I got free shipping so I can't wait for it to print and arrive. Got anything for Traveller?

    Thanks for writing this up! I'm currently using this to make [my own fantasy sandbox](http://lionsandthieves.blogspot.ca/2016/01/making-fantasy-sandbox-part-i.html) over at my blog. I'm going for a high level of detail and realism, which your guide is great for. Glad to have found it!

    Are the last items (28-34) ever going to be finished?
