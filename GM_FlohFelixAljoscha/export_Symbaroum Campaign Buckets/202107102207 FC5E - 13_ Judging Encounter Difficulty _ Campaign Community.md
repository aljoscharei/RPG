# FC5E13: Judging Encounter Difficulty

**Judging Encounter Difficulty**

Challenge Rating (CR) is D&D’s answer to encounter balance. The higher the CR, the more powerful the creature. Ergo, higher-level parties can take on higher CR creatures.

Yet, there is a fatal flaw in this system. It assumes all parties are equal.

Player experience, party composition, and so on determine how powerful the party is yet CR is unable to account for these factors.

Due to this, you’ll need to add tailor-made challenges to your encounters to match their potential.

**Challenging a Powerful party**

Combat is the focal point of D&D’s mechanics. Ergo, if the combat is mindless and easy, then the campaign is boring.

Challenging encounters keep the party engaged during your sessions, making the whole campaign a memorable experience.

Creatures are a prime target for buffs, tweaks, or homebrewing to challenge the party. These custom changes also let you tailor the creature to the party’s abilities.

The battlefield is another aspect that can be modified to enhance combat. Different types of terrain, traps, and obstacles. foster dynamic and tactical combat encounters.

**Relevant Rules**

Creature customization is a hands-on approach for increasing encounter difficulty. Adding traits, increasing damage, and bolstering defenses are all ways to enhance creatures.

Pages 275-283 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide (DMG) is a great resource for modifying creatures. It also includes a helpful CR table for balance purposes.

You’ll also want to consider the encounter rules on pages 81-85 of the DMG. This section contains all the guidelines for creating a set of balanced encounters for an adventuring day.

**Pre-Modification Checklist**

Ensure that you’re following the encounter balance guidelines before modifying anything.

The most important guideline is that each adventuring day contains at least 6-8 medium or hard encounters.

Keep in mind that this is a sliding scale. Fewer deadly encounters or a plethora of easy encounters will suffice.

This frequency ensures that the party is being drained of resources.

Resource management is important for balancing long rest classes like wizards who have a limited number of powerful spells per day.

Multiple encounters per day keep these classes honest by having them conserve resources.

You’ll also want to limit the number of short rests the party takes. The DMG suggests that the party gets only 2 short rests per adventuring day.

Too many short rests will make short rest classes such as monks overpowered.

For example, monks will not need to conserve their ki if they have a short rest after every encounter.

**Keep Track of Damage Types**

Characters may gain resistance or immunity to damage types as they level-up. These are powerful defensive bonuses but they can trivialize many encounters.

If the party gravitates toward dealing a specific damage type that will limit your pool of potential creatures.

Here are the two primary solutions for damage type-related woes:

*   Reskin the creature’s resistance or damage
*   Select different creatures

Keep in mind that you shouldn't always counter the party in this manner. Let the party shine, but don't let them limit your options too much.

**Empower Your Creatures**

One effective way to empower your creatures is to add cover to the environment. Cover provides a flat AC bonus for your creatures, giving them a defensive edge over the party.

Legendary Actions are an excellent addition to any creature’s statblock. These extra actions help level the natural action economy imbalance between the creatures and the party.

Legendary Actions also help shore-up a creature’s weak points. If a creature lacks maneuverability, a Legendary Action including the Disengage Action will do wonders for them.

Lair Actions are another option for powering-up your creatures. These extra actions can empower the creature or distribute setbacks to the party.

**Add Minions**

Matching or surpassing the party’s action economy is important. In doing so you ensure that the creatures get the same number of opportunities as the party.

After all, opportunities are everything in combat. Even if they don’t pan-out.

Adding a squad of minions is an enormous addition to your creatures' action economy.

Creatures can also use minions as shields or distractions to prolong their lives. For example, they can use them to trigger the party's Reactions so that they can reposition.

They can also call upon spellcaster minions to provide support and utility, or to Counterspell the enemy’s spells.

**Traps and Environmental Hazards**

Traps and hazards are another way to add extra danger to the encounter.

Traps and hazards are flexible. They can provide crowd control, battlefield control, or even damage. Making them a solid addition to an encounter if the creatures are lacking any of these.

Creatures can use their knowledge of these traps to lure the party into an unideal position. This gives them extra battlefield control over the party.

**Example: Challenging a Skilled Party**

Our example party consists of the following:
Eldritch Knight Fighter
College of Lore Bard
Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian
Grave Domain Cleric
This is a beefy party. Both the fighter and the barbarian make for an impressive frontline. The fighter with their defensive spells, and the barbarian with their high HP and damage resistance.

The cleric and bard provide tons of support and utility. Their healing and buffs turn their frontline into immortal powerhouses.

This is a tough party to challenge head-on due to their phenomenal frontline. Yet, they do have some key weak areas:
No ranged attackers
3/4 of the party are spellcasters
Minions with Counterspell are an exceptional addition to challenge this party. They can negate key utility and healing from the cleric and bard, or handwave the fighter’s key defensive spells.

**Artillery-type creatures** are fantastic adversaries for this party. Due to their lack of ranged damage, the party has few answers to their damage.

**Creating a Greater Challenge**

An experienced and tactically-minded party is a great gift to have. However, oftentimes they soar past 5e's difficulty thresholds.

There are many ways to increase the difficulty of encounters without throwing extra enemies at the party. Adding traps, hazards, minions, or modifying the creatures are all examples of this.

A party that has to earn its victory is a happy and attentive one. At the end of the day, this result is worth the extra effort.
