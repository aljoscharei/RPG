# Hex Exploration p 19
compare [[202002270909 On Downtime and Demesnes#Clearing and securing Terrain]]

It is assumed that every hex has a certain number of interesting features such as ruined buildings, toppled monuments, caves, and so forth in addition to monster lairs.[[202002270909 On Downtime and Demesnes#Contents of an uncivilized six-mile hex]] Traveling through a hex only reveals those features on the adventurers’ direct path; traveling (?, not exploration?) within a hex can uncover all of the secrets it contains.

Adventurers can explore the land within a hex, as opposed to merely passing through . Again, there are two options, depending on how populated a hex is with features. If there is only one point of interest within a hex, and the hex is not divided into subhexes, it merely takes a given number of days to search the hex, and a roll is made to determine when the point of interest is encountered. If there are multiple features within a hex it is recommended that the hex be divided into subhexes, and the exploration rate given in terms of subhexes. **In both cases the speed of exploration is based upon terrain and not the party’s movement rate.**

The amount of time it takes to fully explore a hex is dependent upon the terrain, as follows:

➢ Plains/Grassland/Desert: 8 subhexes per day (three days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or 1 subhex every 60 minutes (1 hour).

➢ Hills/Broken/Light Forest: 4 subhexes per day (six days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), 1 subhex every two hours.

➢ Mountain/Heavy Forest: 3 subhexes per day (eight days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or 1 subhex every 160 minutes (2 and 2/3 hours).

➢ Jungle/Swamp: 2 subhexes per day (twelve days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or 1 subhex every four hours.

If a hex consists of multiple terrain types simply determine the length of time it takes per subhex and total those times daily to determine how much the adventurers are able to explore.

Hex exploration can be sped up if the party has an aerial spotter, adjusting exploration times as follows:

➢ Plains/Grassland/Desert: 12 subhexes per day (two days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or one subhex every 40 minutes.

➢ Hills/Broken: 6 subhexes per day (four days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or one subhex every 80 minutes.

➢ Forest: No reduction in time, although tall features that break the tree-line or gaps in the tree cover will be spotted automatically.

➢ Mountain: 4 subhexes per day (six days to explore an entire hex), or one subhex every two hours.

➢ Jungle/Swamp: No reduction in time, although tall features that break the tree-line or gaps in the tree cover will be spotted automatically.

In order to gain the benefits of an aerial spotter, however, at least 3/4 of the party must be on the ground, whether mounted or on foot. There must, in other words, be boots on the ground.

Hex exploration cannot be sped up by forced marching or increasing the movement rate of the searchers. However, the adventurers could certainly split into multiple parties to increase the area that can be searched, provided they have the numbers to do so.

The following assumptions are made when exploring a hex:

➢ The party starts exploring wherever they enter the hex, and travel in a manner that allows them to pass from sub-hex to sub-hex in the most efficient manner – usually by moving left to right to left, or up then down then up. Of course, the party can declare they’re exploring the hex in any manner they see fit.

➢ **Entering a sub-hex is enough to discover whatever feature or lair is to be found within it, unless it is cunningly concealed, invisible or otherwise difficult to perceive**. In such cases there should be some condition that must be met for discovering the feature (“the Ossified Pyramid is only visible in the light of a full moon”). It is also possible that certain features, especially those of a magical nature, are not noticed until the proper conditions are met.

➢ The adventurers are moving at a rate generally equivalent to cautious dungeon movement; they’ve got decent chances to notice tracks, avoid ambushes, etc.

➢ As a general rule, creatures that lair within a given sub-hex will leave signs of their presence in the ring of sub-hexes immediately surrounding their lair.

➢ For every day spent searching roll for random encounters as per the terrain.

➢ If the party engages in combat reduce the number of sub-hexes that can be explored for the day by one for each encounter, regardless of injuries.

➢ It is assumed that the adventurers camp in the final sub-hex they search for the day. Otherwise, they may, if desired, establish a base camp guarded by mercenaries to use as a relatively safe place to stay (and a place for injured characters to recover). If the party is retreating to a base camp established elsewhere reduce the number of subhexes explored per day by 1. The base camp must either be in the hex being explored or within three miles of that hex.

➢ A base camp is a stationary location to which the adventurers return every night. It allows the party to fortify a single location to be as defensible as possible, as well as provide a location where any injured can recover from wounds through rest, if needed.

Characters have a 1 in 6 chance of discovering any monster tracks when they enter a new sub-hex (rolled once for the party, not each character). If a member of the party is an experienced outdoorsperson or elf this chance is increased to 1-2 in 6. This assumes that there is, in fact, a monster lairing within that specific subhex and that the monster can leave some sort of tracks; it serves to give advance warning that a threat may be lurking within.

If a hex is being cleared to found or expand one’s domain the hex must be kept cleared by regular patrols, or else empty lairs or suitable features may become inhabited again by monsters (see below). Refer to p. 22 for more information on this.

![[Hex Exploration.jpg]]
## Example.
This example assumes no encounters that result in combat. A party starts out exploring a hex that is mostly forest. They explore four subhexes (two full subhexes and four half subhexes) the first day, another four subhexes (three full subhexes and two half subhexes) the second day and another four subhexes (four full subhexes) the third day. At this point they decide to establish a base camp (in subhex 0405), so their explorations thereafter are reduced in scope by one subhex per day since they need to return to base camp at the end of each day. In day four they explore three subhexes (two full subhexes and two half subhexes). The terrain then opens up into grasslands, and they are able to explore seven subhexes on day five, leaving two full subhexes and two half subhexes for day six. The party finishes exploring the hex with five hours left in the day.

## Getting Lost While Exploring a Hex

There still exists a chance to get lost while exploring within a hex, but it is treated differently than getting lost while traveling overland. The assumption is that when a hex is being explored the adventurers are moving at a slower pace, paying close attention to landmarks, notable features, and surveying as they go.

The chances of getting lost while exploring within a hex are half what they are when traveling overland, rounding down. Do not apply modifiers for forced marching or traveling at night, as neither of these can be done during exploration. If the adventurers are being pursued and attempting to evade a foe treat it as normal movement, not exploration.

If the result indicates the adventurers do get lost, this manifests in one of two ways: getting lost, and getting delayed. Actually getting lost while exploring within a hex only occurs on a roll of natural 1. If this occurs roll 1d6 and reference the diagram below to determine which direction they travel in.

![[Hex Getting Lost.jpg]]

If the path the adventurers take brings them to a subhex they have already explored, have the party guide (or most woodswise character) make an Intelligence check. In most instances they must roll their Intelligence or lower on 3d6. In heavy woods, jungles, swamps, and deserts use 4d6. If the check succeeds the adventurer realizes they are lost.

If the adventurers do not realize they are lost upon entering a previously explored subhex roll again to determine the direction in which they head. If they enter *another* previously explored subhex they can roll again, as above. Otherwise, it is handled as below.

If the adventurers enter a subhex that has not yet been explored they do not get a chance to roll to determine if they realize they are lost until the following morning. Note that they may realize this sooner if they have established a base camp and discover they cannot find their way back to it.

Likewise, if the adventurers, in the course of their stumbling about, come upon an easily recognizable feature – such as a structure, road, lake, etc. – they should be able to determine they have gotten turned around.

The other result of a failed roll – the one that happens on any failed result other than a natural 1 – is that the adventurers get delayed. Roll 1d8 to determine how many hours the adventurers lose off of the adventuring day.






# Reddit Lairs Discussion

Dungeon Lairs in OSE

Once again I find myself bogged down in trying to make a dungeon.

  

This time I'm trying to parse out how Dungeon Lairs work, particularly in the Context of Old School Essentials. For context I am a "roll the bones then interpret/massage the results" type of guy. I don't like trying to come up with everything on my own because it never feels right.

  

What is a Dungeon Lair? Is it every room that I roll a Monster & Treasure result for? If not, how do I decide how to place them?

  

Furthermore how does one differentiate a Dungeon Lair from any other room with monsters? I read once that they are "where the monster lives". If so, what about monsters in other rooms? Are they just wandering around? Do they need a home somewhere in the dungeon too?

  

And related to this is treasure. Certain TTs belong in lairs- ok, fair enough. I read on Dragonsfoot once that unguarded treasures belong in Monster & Treasure rooms that aren't designated as Lairs.

  

This is why I suck at running OSR games, I always get caught up in trying to parse this stuff out. Any suggestions?

Generally speaking, most monsters need somewhere to sleep and thus will have lairs. Exceptions would include things like gelatinous cubes and other oozes, which likely spend all their time wandering, unless they are trapped in a secret chamber or something.

  

Wandering monsters in general I tend to think of as existing in kind of a quantum state. They represent either additional members of a tribe or group of the same type of creature on the same or a neighboring level, out on some business such as hunting, scouting, or getting water, or possibly a nomadic hunter or visitor either from outside the dungeon or from an as-yet undefined lower level.

  

Some folks (Dave Arneson was, I think, the original pioneer) draw all their wandering monsters from the pre-defined population of an area or level, and subtract them from that populace. Of course, if the purpose of wandering monsters is to "punish" the players for inefficient time usage by giving them extra encounters which don't have much or any treasure, then you may not want to let them reduce the existing defined numbers of monsters in lairs.

  

As a general stocking guideline, the INTENT as I understand it is that the DM exercises fiat to "thoughtfully place" at least a few major treasures, special tricks, and monster lairs on each level, and then the random tables are used for filling out extra space procedurally. As for how you decide? Good question. If you don't have inspiration for that, maybe start by procedurally generating a level, then pick your favorite spots or monsters and flesh them out a bit. If you've got a dungeon level with, say, 36 rooms, per the stocking table they will break down roughly as follows:

# Dungeon stockkng table

12 "Empty" (though they can still have clues or evidence of monsters or hints of other content in the dungeon), 2 of which have hidden treasure.

  

12 with monsters in them, of which 6 have treasure.

  

6 Special, with some kind of weird or interesting magical effect or trickery to interact with. These I find are always one of the trickiest things to generate because they really call for a lot of creativity. I steal good trick and "special" ideas constantly from modules and people's game reports).

  

6 Traps, 2 of which will be guarding some sort of treasure. These, too, can require some creativity, but stealing shamelessly from modules, blogs and such is a great idea.



- Bigger than that, Courtney Campbell of the Hack & Slash blog also has a huge doc on tricks and traps I highly recommend.

# Process if making a Dungeon  

Ok, so let's say that I have no inspiration whatsoever, but need to generate a dungeon level for my players for the next session or three.

  

Step 1: I will troll through Dyson's Dodecahedron or another online map resource like Donjon or Zorbus, to find or generate a map that strikes me as cool, and has the appropriate number of rooms. Depending on your group and their level of caution, a rate of exploration of 3-5 rooms an hour or roughly a 10-12 encounters (mix of combat, traps, RP, problem solving) in a 3-4 hour timeframe is common, but this is highly variable depending on the group and the efficiency of the players and DM. That 36 above is pretty good.

  

1a) If I have time and inclination, I can alter that map or mash two or more maps together using an image editing application like GIMP.

  

Step 2: Ideally the map itself and/or any evocative text on it (Dyson, for example, loves to give some framing fiction) may have already sparked ideas for specials or monster lairs. If so, great! Place them where they seem appropriate. If not, just roll the bones and start stocking.

  

Step 3: Now that I've got randomly generated content, let's start customizing it. Hopefully some inspiration struck during the random generation, but if not, let's pick, say, 3-4 of those monster + treasure spots, or maybe 3 of the monster lairs with treasure and 1 of the trapped treasures, and add some sauce. Come up with some funky tactics or an interesting personality for a leader monster. Unless your treasure rolls have been really high (the book gives average values for each Treasure Type), give them a couple of extra magic items and some extra loot.

  

Do some math and figure out how much treasure is in the level, in total. **Usually a good pace of advancement has the characters gaining a level roughly every 3-4 sessions**. Aim a little shorter for level 1-2. If it's a starter dungeon, make sure there's enough treasure on the level for a whole party of 6-8 adventurers to at least go from 1st to 2nd level. If you're running OSE, that means (using Fighters as average) in the neighborhood of 12,000-16,000 gp on the level if it's big enough that you expect them to take at least two or three sessions to clear it. 

  

This may seem like a lot, but it's what they need, and they may not find all of it anyway if they don't find the hidden treasures and/or if they make peace with or avoid some of the monsters which have loot.

The Lair is the chamber where the dragon sleeps atop her massive pile of jewels, the cavern or copse where the goblins pitch their camp and keep their loot, or the strongroom where the bandit king keeps his safe full of "tributes" from the surrounding villages. It's the "home base" for a given mob.

Lairs function as a home base for the monsters in the dungeon and are where they store a Treasure Hoard. You use the bigger Number Appearing for a Lair, so a Kobold lair would have 6d10 (33) + some bosses, while a Kobold patrol would have 4d4 (10).

  

It's GM fiat afaik towards whether or not a room stocked has a Lair or a wandering sized population, but the implication is that using the smaller NA means they have no Hoard. If you roll to stock treasure in a room with monsters that wouldn't have any treasure, you stock it with an amount based on the level of the dungeon instead.

  

I tend to place Hoards first then split up the Lair population all over the dungeon level, because even if my party was capable of defeating 8-67 kobolds, that sounds like an absolute nightmare to play out.

A lair can be a single room/cave or an entire dungeon level/cavern. It's up to you to decide. My first suggestion is to use a random dungeon generator, either a book dedicated to the subject like https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/97423/Tome-of-Adventure-Design?term=The+book+of+adventure+des

  

The tome of adventure design, or the random dungeon generator in the back of the 1st edition DMG.
[[201907132204 Tome of Adventure Design MOC]]
  

This book is also good, and one of my favorites: [[Oldskull Dungeon Generator.pdf]]



I would stay away from online random generators, as they take everything away from you creatively. Get yourself some graph Paper and start drawing your dungeon.

  

Have fun storming the castle!

  

PS: A "Lair" is an ambiguous term. Many different monsters can "lair" in the same area. It's more of a difference between small bands of wandering monsters and a higher concentration of them in an area. My home is my "lair" but I wander around my neighbourhood.

# Lairs
The Filling in the Blanks supplement deals specifically with the generation and placement of features and touches generally on the generation of lairs. This book goes into more detail about the generation of lairs, populating them with creatures, and how monster lairs interact with their surroundings.

  

For the purposes of this book a “lair” is a fixed encounter location containing a roughly homogeneous collection of monsters (or humans). Lairs are considered distinct from dungeons, which tend to contain multiple encounters with traps, many different types of creatures, and require exploration of their own.

  

Note that some monsters – especially more intelligent ones – may have lairs containing more than one type of creature: a goblin village may have wolves or dire wolves that act as mounts and guards. Orc villages have a chance to contain ogres and trolls. Additionally, as distinct from dungeons, lairs tend to be on the surface, although many creatures make use of small cave systems (which may themselves tie into larger dungeon complexes). Finally, a dungeon is often considered a distinct and somewhat insular ecosystem, with inhabitants rarely leaving for the outside world. The residents of lairs are much more likely to venture out into – and be encountered in – the outside world.

  

When determining the number of lairs in a hexcrawl that uses subhexes assume there are 1d6 lairs in every 6-mile hex. As an optional rule, the following can be done with certain terrain types:

  

➢ Roll 1d4 or 1d6–1 for plains, grasslands, clear, and settled terrain. 

➢ Roll 1d8 or 1d6+1 for jungles, swamps, or mountains.

  

If the hex size is smaller than 6 miles the number of lairs can be reduced; if greater than 6 it can be increased.

  

If the Referee is not using subhexes, but rather undivided 6-mile hexes, assume that each hex has a 1-2 in 6 chance of containing a lair. Again, the supplement Filling in the Blanks contains detailed rules for determining the generation of lairs and features that can be used in place of this general rule.

  

The generation of lairs uses tables similar to those used for wilderness encounters, customized to include all potential monsters (the encounter tables found in OSE

  

Core and Advanced monster books do not include entries for sedentary monsters).

  

When placing lairs assume they occupy either a natural hollow, depression, or otherwise hidden or defensible spot in the case of intelligent creatures and animals. Undead, constructs, and other non-intelligent threats don’t necessarily concern themselves with concealment, or even making a semi-permanent home. This is not always the case, however; many undead – intelligent and non – shun light, and will lair in dark crevices, caverns, barrows, dilapidated structures, etc. The encounter tables also includes monsters that are traditionally only found underground; they are labeled as such, and it is assumed that any such result indicates the creature’s lair

is underground or in an isolated, enclosed place like the cellar of a house, etc.

  

The monster entries on the encounter tables are not weighted for strength (often referred to as “Challenge Rating”) nor frequency. It is recommended that the Referee use the “Double Dragon” rule if they want to reduce the number of powerful monsters encountered. This rule calls for rerolling any results that indicate a monster with more than 5 HD, taking the new result regardless of its HD. This rule reduces the number of powerful monsters that will be encountered, effectively weighting the tables toward

  

more moderate threats. Should the Referee want to restrict encounters to creatures in the Core book they can roll a smaller die that fits within the desired range. Conversely, customized placement tables (see Table 6.16 for an example) can be crafted to provide weighted encounters.

  

Each creature table has a number of entries for a given terrain type. The entries are filled first by creatures from OSE Core, then from the Advanced Monster book, and then, when possible, are rounded out using monsters from other (free) OSR sources. Each column indicates which dice are to be rolled to determine the encounter; n a result of “Another source” is indicated the monster will be (1-4) chosen from another source or (5-6) unique.

  

Tables 6.2-6.14 are populated with as many creatures as possible to provide a broad source of varied monsters to place. Should the Referee want to narrow the focus – or is populating a region with a limited number of creatures – Table 6.15 is a blank encounter table. It is divided into fourteen columns, with each containing monsters of a specific type. The frequency of encounter by terrain type (found on Table 6.1) can be transferred over to this blank table, or the Referee can assign numbers as makes sense based on their location. Finally, Table 6.16 gives

  

an example of a regional lair generator. The advantage of using a regional lair placement is that it provides a tighter focus to the types of creatures found in a region while still allowing some variance. On the other hand, it does require more work to populate a table for each region. The “Unique” column in the regional lair placement allows the Referee to provide specific unique lairs; either a new type of creature native to the region, or named creatures (such as Cugrorn, the lich-lord, or Doomlor the dire boar). When a unique creature comes up as a result the Referee should remove its entry from future rolls, either replacing it with another creature or leaving the entry blank, as desired.

  

Intelligent, tool- or magic-using monsters will defend or guard their lair as appropriate, as well as ally with other creatures in the area.

  

Watery Lairs

  

These tables, designed to place creature lairs rather than generate encounters, present an issue when it comes to generating lairs in watery (river, lake, or

  

ocean) terrain. What exactly does that mean? The Referee has several options:

  

➢ It can be an actual lair. Aquatic creatures or plants will live in the water, or perhaps under it, while non-aquatic creatures have to be handled with more care. Perhaps a non-aquatic species has adapted to life underwater, or lives underwater through magical means (a submerged city encased in a bubble of fresh air). Perhaps the creature lairs

on a semi-permanent structure or land mass above the water: a floating mass of seaweed large enough to support creatures, or a boat, or perhaps the Referee decides to place an actual landmass in the hex in which the lair is generated.

  

➢ A non-aquatic creature is traveling but, when the hex is first entered, is assumed to be in the location where it will be encountered. Once the hex is entered by the adventurers a countdown begins, at the end of which the creature will move on to a different location.

  

➢ The creature lairs nearby and considers the water as part of its territory. It may lair along a riverbank, or

  

atop cliffs overlooking a storm-tossed sea. If this is the case, use whatever terrain type is closest to generate the lair, ignoring any results that could not realistically “travel” to the water-bound. This is especially good for flying creatures, monsters that are amphibious in nature, or humanoids capable of using watercraft.

  

➢ Don’t be afraid to look up! Perhaps the creature lairs in a permanent dwelling above the water: an everpresent waterspout that supports a floating palace, high above the waves, or a cloud city that wanders to and fro over an ocean.

  

Each hex should have a random encounter table that draws its contents from from the hex itself, as well as from the surrounding hexes. On average, a random encounter table should be constructed using a dice range between 1d6 and 1d10, with 1d8 being the average.

  

If using subhexes with the potential for multiple lairs per hex it becomes relatively easy to construct the table, drawing from the immediate hex and the six hexes immediately adjacent to it.

  

If using undivided hexes, which may or may not contain a lair, the Referee may need to draw from hexes further afield to construct the tables.

  

The main question to ask when constructing wandering monster tables is what the range of each monster is. This question can be answered, or at least approximated, using the %-in-lair number. OSE does not include this as part of the monster stat block, but OSRIC (and other systems) do use these numbers (note that OSRIC calls it the “lair probability” number).

  

If using the subhex system the %-in-lair number can be used as follows:

  

➢ If the number is 100% the monster will not be encountered elsewhere in the hex and will only be encountered in their lair. Ex. Crypt things.

  

➢ If the number is between 1 and 99% the range of the creature will be a number of hexes equal to 1 plus the number of times the percentage can be multiplied by 2 before reaching 100.

  

Example 1. Bugbears have a lair probability of 25%. They can be found in their lair hex (25%), the next ring of hexes (50%), and the third ring of hexes (100%), bounded by the black line. See the map, below.

  

Example 2. Goblins have a lair probability of 40%. They can be found in their initial hex (40%) and the first ring (80%) of six hexes immediately surrounding the central hex (bounded by the purple line).

  

Example 3. Grimlocks have a lair probability of 75%. They will only be found in the central hex.

  

If no lair probability is given it means the creature is nomadic and will move on from the indicated hex 1d12 weeks after the adventurers first enter the hex.

  

Giants (humanoids of ogre-size or larger, large dinosaurs, etc.) and flying creatures have their range doubled. Giant flying creatures (such as rocs, dragons, etc.) have their range quadrupled.

  

As a general rule, the greater the range of a creature, the more likely the given monster type is to be found within an adjacent hex – and the greater the chance the creature will be on the wandering encounter table there. Hill giants are more likely to be encountered within one adjacent hex than kobolds, since hill giants have a greater range, so if the Referee has to choose between one of the two to add it makes sense to add the hill giants.

  

As can be seen from those supplied here, there should be plenty of monsters to draw from to populate individual wandering encounter tables.

  

A sample encounter table may look like this:

  

1. Goblins (Broken Fang tribe) 3d6

  

2. Goblins (Shattered Sun tribe) 3d6

  

3. Dire wolves (2d4)

  

4. Stirges (3d10)

  

5. Spider, black widow (1d3)

  

6. Antelope, herd (from adjacent hex) (3d10)

  

7. Giant, hill (from adjacent hex) (1d4)

  

8. Roll on Secondary Table Secondary Table

  

1. Trolls (1d6)

  

2. Orcs (3d4)

  

3. Hobgoblins (3d4)

  

4. NPC party

  

5. Ogres (2d4)

  

6. Wolves (2d6)

  

based upon a large geographic area. If there are three goblin tribes in a mountainous region and one goblin entry on the random encounter table, it will be up to the Referee to decide which tribe – if any – is encountered.

  

The base encounter table includes creatures that are either lairing in the given hex or likely to be encountered in that hex from an adjacent hex. Sometimes a Secondary Table can be included. Encounters on this table may be:

  

➢ Drawn from the surrounding hexes, but are creatures that are less likely to be encountered than those on the primary table.

  

➢ Creatures that do not lair nearby but are drawn from the appropriate terrain tables. These represent traveling monsters that can be encountered in this area.

  

Encounter tables can also include events such as hazards, weather conditions, random magical occurrences, etc. that occur when rolled.

  

Finally, the Referee may decide they don’t want to invest in that much detail, and just create encounter tables

  

When a hex or subhex that contains a lair is entered, the lair probability roll can be used to determine if the creature is currently in its lair. For solitary creatures and small groups there’s a chance that the lair is completely empty. For larger groups – if a humanoid village is encountered, for instance – the lair will rarely be completely empty.

  

Roll the lair probability as normal, and if the result of the roll indicates that the monster is in the lair then all of the inhabitants will be discovered in their lair. If the result indicates they are not in their lair proceed as follows:

  

➢ If the inhabitants are herd animals or monsters that travel in packs (such as wolves, or hellhounds) assume the lair is empty.

  

➢ If there is only a single inhabitant the lair is empty. Note that intelligent monsters rarely leave their lair unguarded for any significant amount of time.

  

➢ If the inhabitants congregate in small numbers or are vermin, bugs, or other unintelligent monsters, roll 1d8. On a result of 1-3 the lair will be empty, otherwise there will be a number of monsters left equal to the roll × 10%.

  

➢ Humans and humanoids will rarely abandon their lair entirely. Roll 1d8; on a result of 1 the lair will be completely empty, otherwise there will be a percentage of monsters remaining equal to the result of the roll × 10%.

  

➢ If the inhabitants are powerful monsters that appear in small numbers (dragon-kin, giant-kin, etc.) roll 1d6. On a result of 1-3 all of the monsters are absent, otherwise only 50% of the number will be absent.

  

The Referee should, of course, use their best judgment when determining if any inhabitants are currently in the lair. If young are present it is unlikely the lair will be completely abandoned.

  

Absent monsters will return as follows; roll 1d6: (1) in 1d4 turns, (2-3) in 1d4 hours, (4-5) in 3d4 hours, (6) in 1d4 days.

  

Example. The party enters a subhex containing a goblin village with 32 inhabitants. Goblins, according to OSRIC, will be found in their lair 40% of the time. The Referee rolls 1d100 and gets an 80; the goblins are not in their lair. However, goblins are intelligent, so she further rolls 1d8, and gets a 4. 40% of the goblins (13) are still in the village.

  

If a lair is eliminated (those dwelling within are slain or driven away) it results in the specific monster entry being removed from the random encounter table. Once a lair is cleared there is a chance – assuming it’s not secured by the adventurers (see p. 22) – of it being repopulated anew. At the end of each month after a lair has been cleared make a wandering monster check using the given chances for the terrain type. If the result is positive for an encounter it means that the lair has been repopulated by a randomly determined monster. Once a lair has been repopulated the monster type is added to the encounter table for that hex.

  

For instance, assume that a hex contains three lairs:

  

1. The Broken Fang goblin tribe

  

2. Dire wolves

  

3. Antelope herd

  

Over a period of two weeks the adventurers succeed in eliminating the goblin tribe and the dire wolf lair. If the adventurers do not patrol the hex the Referee rolls encounter checks for each month the lairs remain unpopulated (unless otherwise stated these checks are made at the end of each

  

month, starting one full month after the lair has been unoccupied). If the result indicates an encounter, that means a new creature has moved in to occupy the lair.

  

Entering a Subhex with a Lair

  

Whenever the adventurers enter a subhex containing a lair, assume that they automatically become aware of it unless it is hidden or otherwise not immediately visible; if the lair is inside a larger complex it might take some searching to discover. In the rare instance when a lair is hidden or concealed there are several ways its presence can be discovered:

  

➢ Assign a chance for woodswise characters to spot the lair in a manner similar to elves or dwarves spotting secret doors and the like.

  

➢ The adventurers have a chance to discover the presence of the lair’s inhabitants – either by encountering the inhabitants or stumbling across their spoor – and are able to track or follow those back to the lair.

  

The Referee should determine how alert and prepared the inhabitants are.

  

The first question is pretty easy to answer: humans and humanoids that lair in large groups will almost always post guards or have some sort of early detection system, while intelligent creatures that lair in small groups giants, dragons, etc. – will often either have some manner of trap to alert them to the presence of an intruder or will have others stand guard for them. Creatures of less intelligence than, say, goblins, will most often not post guards. If there are guards posted it is a safe assumption that the first encounter will be between the party and the guards, unless suitable precautions are taken.

  

When the lair is encountered make a modified surprise roll for both sides to determine if either is able to detect the presence of the other.

  

➢ If the party has more than ten members add +1 to the monster’s roll.

  

➢ If more than half the party is mounted add +1 to the monster’s roll.

  

➢ If the monster has guards posted add +1 to the roll.

  

➢ If the monster has taken pains to hide their lair subtract –1 from the party’s result.

  

➢ If the adventurers are aware that there is an encounter nearby (they are following tracks, have been alerted by other nearby monsters, seen the spoor the residents create, etc.) add +1 to the party’s roll.

  

➢ If the lair is exceptionally large, such as an entire village of goblins, or a lair of giants, add +1 to the party’s roll.

  

➢ If the “party” consists of one or two advance scouts used to moving through the wilderness stealthily, the monsters suffer a –1 penalty.

  

➢ Do not add Dexterity modifiers to either roll.

  

➢ If the lair’s inhabitants are sensitive to light and the encounter occurs during the day apply a –1 penalty to the inhabitants’ roll. If the encounter occurs at night and the inhabitants can see in the dark subtract –1 from the party’s roll.

  

As with normal surprise rolls a given side is surprised on a result of 1-2. Use the encounter distance by terrain table to determine when a lair is first “seen” (and surprise can first occur). Note that lairs are often much larger – and much more obvious – than a group of monsters, so are often apparent at two or three times the given distances.

  

Creatures that leave their lair will often leave spoor – or signs of their presence – nearby that can alert careful expeditions. Use the same guidelines as described above to determine the creature’s range, but instead of full 6-mile hexes the scale is reduced to subhex size.

  

Goblins have a range of 2 hexes (their own hex and the first ring surrounding it), so their spoor can be found within the subhex containing their lair and the ring of subhexes immediately surrounding it. To use the following hex as an example, if their lair is in subhex 0404, signs of their presence can be detected in subhexes 0404, 0405, 0504, 0503, 0403, 0303, and 0304.

  

Flying creatures, normal predators (such as wolves or great cats), and creatures that are naturally sneaky or leave little

  

sign (such as bugbears, skeletons, etc.) have the range of their spoor reduced by half, to a minimum of 1 subhex.

  

When the adventurers enter a new subhex roll for the party to determine if they spot any existing spoor. The roll is made once, regardless of the individuals in the party, as follows:

  

➢ There’s a base 1-2 in 6 chance of spotting the traces.

  

➢ Increase this chance by 1 if there are any elves or halflings in the party.

  

➢ Increase this chance by 1 if there are any thieves or druids in the party.

  

➢ Increase the chance by 2 if there is a ranger in the party.

  

➢ Decrease the chance by 1 if it is raining.

  

How This All Comes Together

  

When it comes down to actual gaming the order of operations is as follows:

  

1. The adventurers define which areas they’re going to search, and the approximate route they want to take.

  

2. The Referee rolls to determine what the weather will be like. It is recommended that the weather be generated in advance by at least several weeks.

  

3. The Referee determines how long it will take to explore each sub-hex based on terrain type.

  

4. The Referee rolls for random encounters and chances of getting lost.

  

5. If a random encounter occurs determine which subhex it occurs in and what the encounter is with.

  

6. As the adventurers explore each subhex, roll to see if they notice signs of the presence of monsters in nearby subhexes.

  

7. As the adventurers enter each subhex they automatically encounter any features or lairs within the subhex.

  

8. If the adventurers are just traveling through, then only the land immediately surrounding their path is mapped. If they’re exploring within a hex, the hex is considered fully mapped once all of the subhexes have been physically explored. At this point the adventurers learn the number of resources within a hex as well as their approximate value.

  

9. A hex is cleared once the occupants of all lairs within it have been killed, driven off, or reassoned with.
