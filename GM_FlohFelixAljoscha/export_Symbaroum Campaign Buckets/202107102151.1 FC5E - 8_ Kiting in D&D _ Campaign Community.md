# 8: Kiting in D&D

**Kiting in D&D 5e**
Artillery type creatures are staples in encounters due to their high damage output. Being ranged attackers, these creatures are also flexible with their positioning.
Artillery units pair well with frontline units such as brutes and skirmishers. Artillery can shoot from the backline while the frontline keeps melee units from reaching the artillery.
A problem arises when the party breaks through your creatures’ frontline. Your artillery units are defenseless due to their lack of defensive stats and traits.
One way to mitigate this problem is by using a tactic called kiting. Kiting leverages a ranged attacker’s movement to lure melee combatants around the battlefield.
When used well, kiting increases artillery's survivability while alleviating pressure from your frontline.
**What is Kiting?**
Kiting is a term often used in player vs. player video games. To kite someone means leveraging terrain, abilities, and movement to avoid a melee unit that is pursuing them.
5e has similar mechanics that make kiting a possibility. For example, difficult terrain or spells that reduce movement.
There are two possible reasons why a ranged combatant would choose to kite a target:

1.  To lure their target to a location such as an ambush
2.  To keep their distance from their target

Enemies that are being kited must sacrifice their damage output in favor of mobility to catch up. They could also swap to a suboptimal ranged weapon.
Both outcomes are tactical wins for you. You've weakened the opposition while alleviating stress from your frontline units.
**An Overview of Kiting**
Artillery should always begin combat far from the enemy. The only exception to this rule is being ambushed.
The essence of kiting is preserving the artillery's initial distance from the enemy. To do so you’ll need to use any resources you can.
These resources may include spells, difficult terrain, movement advantages, and any battlefield obstacles.
A kiting scenario begins once a melee unit advances toward an artillery unit.
You then move the artillery unit away from their allies, preserving the rest of your backline units.
Next, continue to keep yourself at a distance from your target. This often forces the enemy to waste resources on catching up or to take uncontested damage.
**Determine Your End Goal**
The first step of kiting is to determine where you want the target to go. In most scenarios, the answer is further away from your allies or to a predetermined location.
Kiting a target away from your allies removes the target from the fight. This alleviates pressure from your allies.
The downside to this goal is that it’s difficult for your allies to come and assist.
A predetermined location might include luring the target into a trap or an ambush. While this is challenging to pull off, it’s a safer maneuver than kiting to buy time.
**Keep Your Distance**
The most important thing to remember when kiting is to **keep moving.** Maintain a healthy distance from the target to ensure they cannot reach you.
The average medium-size adventurer has 30 ft. of movement. Therefore, creatures faster than this have an innate advantage to kiting. The difference in speed alone forces the target to use at least one Dash action throughout the kite.
Unique types of movement such as burrowing and flying also aid in kiting as they allow the user to ignore obstacles while moving.
Swimming is another type of unique movement that can assist in kiting. Though it has more limitations than flying or burrowing.
**Slow the Target Down**
We cannot rely on having an innate movement advantage for every kiting scenario. We must create our own opportunities.
**Slowing the target down** or otherwise reducing their movement accomplishes this.
**Goading the creature into Difficult Terrain** is one option. Difficult Terrain halves a creature’s movement speed. If you are outside of this area while the target is in it then you’ve doubled your movement in comparison.
If there is no area of difficult terrain, spells like Grease and Spike Growth that can create some in a pinch.
You can also reduce a creature’s movement by using spells like Ray of Frost or Slow. While this is an easier option to use in combat, it requires a creature with specific spell options.
Eliminating the target’s movement is also an effective way to widen the gap while kiting. Control spells like Hold Person/Monster or even a Net can do this.
Obstacles on the battlefield can also slow the target down. If the target has to waste movement maneuvering around a boulder to reach you, you’ll have extra movement by comparison.
**Keep Attacking**
You need to keep the target enticed as you kite them. You do not want them to give up on the chase before you’ve reached your goal.
The easiest way to keep a target interested in their pursuit is to continue attacking them or their allies. Keep imposing a threat so they have no choice but to overcommit to being kited.
**Continue Kiting**
As the encounter continues you need to keep up your kiting efforts on your target. This may require you to match their Dash action with your own or use resources to continue to slow them.
The longer you keep up the effort, the more pressure you’re alleviating from your allies. Especially if you’re forcing the target to waste their turn by using Dash actions.
Continue to reassess your situation as the fight progresses.
If you find that you’re running out of steam, kite the enemy toward your allies so they can help.
If you see that your allies are still overwhelmed, continue to drag the target further away.
Be flexible with your position and think of how you can leverage the situation to help your allies.
**Example: Kiting With Difficult Terrain**
1\. Draw the enemy’s attention.

1\. Move toward the patch of Difficult Terrain.

3\. Leverage the gap between you and the target to move around the terrain. This will force the target to go around the Difficult Terrain or through it, slowing them down.

4\. Continue attacking and drawing the target further away from the fray.
**Keep Moving Forward**
Artillery lacks the physical defenses to handle melee units that close the gap. Kiting gives artillery a higher chance of surviving incoming melee attackers.
The initial reason for kiting is for self-preservation. However, by alleviating pressure from your frontline kiting preserves them as well. It’s a win-win!

**Worksheet Activity - Set Up a Kite**
Deep in the Underdark the party has engaged a group of 5 drow (pg 307 of the SRD or pg 128 of the Monster Manual) in combat. The party’s paladin has broken through your frontline and advances toward the drow in the backline.
How do you kite the paladin safely away from the rest of the drow? Describe your tactics. You can also make a battlemap to use for this scenario.
_**Answers:**
Drow have both spells and poisoned-tipped crossbow bolts that they can utilize to kite creatures.
Adding difficult terrain and/or obstacles can make kiting this creature easier, especially with the drow handcrossbow’s short range._
**How To Summary**

1.  Away from your allies to lighten their load
2.  Lead them into a trap or ambush

2.  **Keep distance between yourself and the target**
    
    1.  Use Difficult Terrain and battlefield obstacles
    2.  Reduce the target’s movement
    
    1.  Entice them to keep up their pursuit
    
    1.  Use a Dash action when needed to keep your distance
    2.  Reassess the situation and redirect the creature as needed
