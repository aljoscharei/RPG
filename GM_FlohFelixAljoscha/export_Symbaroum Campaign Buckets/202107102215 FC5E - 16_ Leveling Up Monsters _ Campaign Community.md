# FC5E16: Leveling Up Monsters

**Leveling Up Monsters**
We often have an adventure idea that includes specific creatures. These foes have the perfect flavors and playstyle to complement our vision.
But when it's time to plan the adventure, we realize that our perfect creature is too weak.
Statblock enhancements are the answer. Numbers tweaks and adding new mechanics will bring a weak creature up to the party's level.
**Creatures, Reborn!**
There are many prolific, but low CR, D&D creatures in 5e. It's frustrating not being able to use these creatures at higher tiers of play
Such creatures are ripe for enhancement. Plus, it's easier than homebrewing creatures as their statblock serves as a blueprint.
These enhancements can also give creatures new flavors for your story. This is a perfect tie-in for using superpowered versions of previously-used creatures.
Enhancing a creature also lets you tailor the creature to the party's tactics and abilities.
**Challenge Rating Matters**
Page 274 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide (DMG) contains a challenge rating (CR) table.
This table provides thresholds for each CR’s damage output and defenses. It's an invaluable reference when leveling up creatures.
**CR Goals**
Before enhancing a creature, determine the intended CR.
Encounter calculators like [Kobold Fight Club](https://kobold.club/fight/#/encounter-builder) can help this exercise.
Next, you'll assess the creature to determine what the most effective type of enhancements for our foe.
Here’s a high-level list of enhancements that correspond with creature types from the creature assessment lesson:

*   Keep their “high-damage” identity as you scale them up.
*   Increase their attack bonus for more accurate attacks.
*   Add extra attacks to their Multiattack

*   Prevent them from being one-shot.

*   Ensure that they stay tanky at high CRs.

*   More tools for running interference on the party’s frontline.

*   Increase their threat to the party, making them a target.

*   Improves their concentration checks and their Save DC.

*   AC improvements help to avoid concentration checks.

*   Improved accuracy and damage allows them to take-down a target.

*   Generates more opportunities to single-out an ideal target.

**Tweaking the Numbers**
Bolstering the creature’s AC, HP, Damage output, attack bonus, number of attacks, and Ability Scores is a sure-fire way to empower them.
Plus, it’s easy to verify the creature’s new CR since these enhancements correspond with the chart in the DMG.
Movement is another powerful addition to the creature’s statblock. Increasing a creature’s speed gives them additional room to position or chase down their foe.
Adding unique movement, like flying, also gives the creature new tactical options.
**Additional Defensive Additions**
High-CR creatures tend to have proficiency in some saving throws. It’s an easy addition to improve their defenses.
Constitution, Dexterity, and Wisdom are the three most popular spell saving throws in 5e. Ensure you include at least one of these when adding saving throw proficiencies.
Damage resistances and immunities bolster a creature’s HP without meddling with it. You can tailor these resistances to the party’s abilities or make a more general selection.
Resistances and immunities encourage the players to try new spells and tactics when their usual ones aren't as effective.
Condition immunities are another excellent addition. These help prevent crowd control, keeping the creature online longer.
Plus, it’s a decent alternative to Legendary Resistance.
**New Traits, New Power**
Traits provide new and unique bonuses to various parts of the creature's statblock.
Traits can also enhance non-combat features. These add flavor and depth to the creature but aren't covered in this lesson as they don’t impact combat.
**Defensive Traits**
These traits bolster the creature’s defenses. For example, they may provide passive healing or enhance the creature's saving throws.
Some examples of defensive traits are:

*   Magic Resistance (Demons)
*   Regeneration (Trolls)
*   Legendary Resistance (Dragons)

**Action Economy Expansion Traits**
These traits give the creature a unique Bonus Action or Reaction. This increases the creature’s action economy and gives them new tools to challenge the party.
Some examples of action economy expansion traits are:

*   Aggressive (Orcs)
*   Nimble Escape (Goblins)
*   Parry (Hobgoblins)

**Offensive Traits**
These traits enhance the creature’s damage output. Either by increasing their damage or by improving their accuracy. These enhancements are often conditional.
Some examples of offensive traits are:

*   Pack Tactics (Kobolds)
*   Brute (Bugbears)
*   Ambusher (Doppelgangers)

**Miscellaneous Traits**
This category contains unique traits that either add a unique Action or a new feature to their statblock.
These traits may fall into the previous categories with regard to their purpose. However, their functionality sets them apart from other traits.
Some examples of miscellaneous traits are:

*   Horrifying Visage (Banshees)
*   Possession (Ghosts)
*   Heated Body (Azer)

**Legendary Creatures**
Legendary Actions and Lair Actions are great additions for enhancing a creature.
These new actions can shore up weaknesses or hone the creature’s strengths. For example, one of the creature’s Legendary Actions could be an attack to increase their damage output.
They’re also a more interactive and interesting solution than tweaking the numbers.
**One-Off Actions**
1/Day actions are one way to add temporary enhancements to the creature’s statblock.
Oftentimes 1/Day actions are in the form of a powerful spell or attack, but they can also work as buffs.
For example, you could copy the mechanics of a [Potion of Giant Strength](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Potion%20of%20Giant%20Strength#content) for a 1/Day action. A brute can use this to boost their strength for the encounter.
This is a flavorful solution for quick-and-dirty numbers tweaks.
**Polish It Off!**
Recalculate the creature’s improved and compare it with the CR table in the DMG. Tweak your changes if you’re above or below the intended CR.
Rinse and repeat this process until you're satisfied.
Keep in mind that there are factors that aren’t accounted for in CR, but still make the creature more powerful. For instance, movement enhancements.
**Leveling Up a Roc**
A roc is already a powerful creature, but what if we scaled it up to CR 13 from CR 11?
Roc 2.0 is a supercharged version of a roc, the result of arcane experimentation. Here are the changes:

*   Increases attack and damage bonuses by +1

*   When the roc is carrying something it can’t use its talons. By putting this extra damage on their beak it ensures this damage is applied more often.

*   Crowd control is a weakness for the roc, this works as a stopgap

Sometimes a few minor tweaks to a creature’s statblock is all that they need to become more competitive. This is often the case with high CR creatures like the roc.
**More Power, More Challenge**
Sometimes the perfect creature isn’t at the perfect CR. By enhancing the creature you can bring them up to par.
Fiddling with a creature’s statblock also allows you to build them to challenge your party. For instance, you can add resistances that hinder the party’s signature spells.
Enhancements breathe new life into low-CR creatures and give them more mileage in a long campaign.

**Worksheet Activity - Level Up an Owlbear**
