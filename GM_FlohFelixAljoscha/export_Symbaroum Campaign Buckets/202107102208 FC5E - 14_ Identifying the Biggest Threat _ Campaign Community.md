# FC5E14: Identifying the Biggest Threat

**Identifying the Biggest Threat in Combat**
Certain player characters pose a significant threat to specific types of creatures.
As a DM you have a grasp on what the PCs are capable of. You know what creatures will struggle against which party member. Conveying this through gameplay and not pure metagaming is difficult.
However, you can use the Wisdom and Intelligence abilities to roleplay how the creatures discern a threat in combat.
In doing so, you can sync roleplay and tactics to reduce this threat to your intended encounter difficulty. Here's how.
**Learning and Reacting to Your Surroundings**
Creatures that can identify the biggest threat to them have a tactical advantage.
By gleaning this information they can make better choices such as:

*   Which target they should focus their attacks
*   Which PCs to avoid
*   When to retreat and regroup

Creatures that know of the party or when they’re arriving can also make advantageous decisions, such as setting up traps or an ambush to mitigate the party’s dangerous abilities.
**The Mechanics of Learning**
Intelligence and Wisdom are how creatures and PCs learn and process information. Both have different approaches.
Definitions for Intelligence and Wisdom are on pages 177-178 of the Player’s Handbook.
Also, refresh yourself with the creature classifications as the rest of this lesson contains many references to them.
**Who’s the Threat?**
Minion-type creatures are weak combatants that swarm their foe. They're often controlled by important creatures such as bosses.
Their strength in numbers is a double-edged sword. Minions are susceptible to all kinds of AoE damage and crowd control.
Any foe that can target many creatures at once is a threat.
Artillery fear direct attacks due to their weak defenses. Melee combatants can rush at them or ranged attackers pose a threat to any artillery.
Brutes are countered by effects that slow them or hinder their action economy. Anything that accomplishes this will prevent brutes from performing their frontline duties.
The most common source of control is spellcasters. Although, melee PCs that can grapple or have features like [Stunning Strike](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Classes:Monk?expansion=5#h-Stunning%20Strike) are also problematic.
Controllers have a few weaknesses. The first is melee attackers. Once in range, these characters can attack them many times. This is not ideal for maintaining concentration on their spells.
Another weakness is spells like [Dispel Magic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dispel%20Magic#content), [Counterspell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Counterspell), or other effects that can disperse crowd control.
Skirmishers will want to avoid ranged attackers. PCs that can shoot from afar have the potential to kite them to death.
**Advanced Tactics: Learning**
This expanded mechanic uses a creature’s Wisdom or Intelligence to determine how they identify threats. We suggest expanding the Ability Score rules to include helping foes identify threats and choose actions accordingly.
This mechanic uses the creature’s Wisdom or Intelligence. whichever ability score modifier is higher. If both are equal, pilot the creature as you see fit.
Use the following table as a reference for how much information a creature’s Wisdom or Intelligence passively gathers:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability Score Range** | **Description** |
| 7 or lower | Unable to discern any useful information. |
| 8-11 | Understands basic functionality of their enemy.<br>e.g. If they are wearing heavy metal armor they’re difficult to hit. |
| 12-15 | Can classify what their enemy is capable of and knows what types of creatures are dangerous.<br>e.g. Magic users may have control spells in their arsenal which you’re susceptible to. |
| 16-19 | This creature uses their advanced Wisdom/Intelligence to make accurate assumptions about their enemy based on their positioning and abilities.<br>e.g. Accurately estimate how much they move and what kinds of spells/features they might use. |
| 20+ | Omniscient. They can make accurate predictions based on little knowledge of the party. |

An intelligent creature uses deductive reasoning to identify a threat. They assess the situation and draw on their knowledge to plan tactics to deal with the threat.
Intelligent creatures are proactive. They use previous experience and knowledge to make educated guesses. If their assumptions are incorrect they pivot and try a new tactic.
A wise creature makes observations using their senses. These creatures often pick up patterns in the enemy’s movements and use this to their advantage.
Wise creatures are reactive. They change their strategies based on how the situation unfolds.
**How to Use This Knowledge**
Avoiding the threat is the safest option. However, this option relies on the state of the encounter and the environment.
Using cover provides a flat AC bonus which is a huge boon. Cover is easy for artillery and controllers to use due to their ranged attacks, but other creatures can still use it if it's nearby.
Hiding from the threat is another option as it breaks the threat’s line of sight. An extra benefit of this is that the hidden creature has advantage on their first attack out of hiding.
Dodging is a fantastic maneuver for strikers and brutes as it penalizes the enemy from attacking them.
A tactical retreat, while difficult to pull off, is rewarding. Creatures that have this luxury can regroup and strike the party at a more opportune time.
It's best to confront the enemy when avoiding them isn’t an option. Once the primary threat is identified, creatures can focus their assault on them. This ensures the threat is quickly neutralized, giving your creatures some breathing room.
Communication is the key to combat. Once a threat is identified, your creatures can call upon each other for aid.
For example, artillery can ask their brute allies to intercept the party's advancing melee attackers. This lets your artillery put distance between them and the target while they shoot it.
**Example - Chain Devil Analysis**
[The chain devil’s statblock is on page 275 of the SRD.](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)
Chain devils are brutes with high potential damage. They also have control abilities such as Unnerving Mask and their chains' grapple.
Crowd control is the chain devil’s weakness. Their Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers are both mediocre, making saving throws difficult.
While Magic Resistance helps offset this, if they're crowd controlled they're finished.
Their Wisdom is higher than their Intelligence. Therefore chain devils are reactive creatures.
Once they pinpoint the origin of the party’s crowd control, they’ll need to neutralize that PC.
If the battlefield permits, they can also get out the PC’s line of sight to prevent the PC from targeting them.
**Knowledge is Power**
The party adjusts and develops tactics based on observations on the enemy. Why shouldn’t the creatures?
By leveraging Intelligence and Wisdom you can role-play how the creatures learn and develop tactics.
In doing so, you make for more believable as well as more tactical and challenging combat.

**Worksheet Activity - Who’s the Threat?**
An invisible stalker [(SRD pg 323)](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) is has ambushed a party that consists of a Wizard, a Rogue armed with a hand crossbow, and a Paladin.
Who is the biggest threat to the creature? How does creature discern this?
**_Answer Key:_**
_The biggest threat is the Paladin due to their Divine Smite bypassing the creature’s resistances and it being a low AC creature. The paladin also has beefy defenses that will ward off the stalker’s mediocre attacks.
The stalker has resistance to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage so the rogue’s attacks, while powerful, are mitigated.
The wizard won’t pose much of a threat. Their control spells are ineffective due to the stalker’s condition immunities. Their damage is troublesome, but the stalker’s 50 ft. of speed lets it get close enough to strike the wizard, allowing it to quickly dispose of them.
The stalker’s Wisdom is higher so they’re a reactive creature._
