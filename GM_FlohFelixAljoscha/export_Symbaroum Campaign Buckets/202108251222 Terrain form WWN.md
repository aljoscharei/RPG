1. Corrupted wasteland. An area here was once xenoformed by the Outsiders into an environment hostile to humanity or one inhabited by dangerous alien lifeforms. 
2. 4 Canyons. A region with extensive canyons cut by rivers present or long-vanished. Make sure the rivers don’t climb after leaving them.
3. 6 Grasslands. A broad sweep of savanna or grassy plains is a coherent whole here.
4. 8 Jagged mountains. A new or re- sharpened mountain range forms a barrier in the region. The mountains are young, tall, and likely cast a substantial **rain shadow.** compare [[202108251225 Air circulation.md]] Air circulation
5. 10 Light forest. Interspersed with other terrain.
6. 12 Pit. A Deep or some other underground megastructure collapsed and left a hole with a diameter measured in tens of miles.
7. 14 Rocky hills. Rough and stony, with little arable land. Herding and raiding are the most pro table employments here.
8. 16 Sand desert. This desert is a waste of sand and dunes. It may be from a rain shadow, or it might be a legacy of ancient war.
9. 18 Swamp. A sinking river, lake margin, or wet coastal delta forms a vast bog in this  at land.
10. 20 Weathered mountains. A significant skirt of hills is common. The rain shadow is likely limited due to the rounded, low mountains.
11. 1 Ancient farmland. A huge stretch of land was re-engineered for optimal farming.
12. 3 Blasted lands. Scorched over by ancient war. Many ruins are likely.
13. 5 Dense forest. Trackless, dark, and an effective natural barrier.
14. 7 Islands. There’s a single significant island off the coast or an archipelago of some note.
15. 9 Jungle. A classic adventure-worthy jungle of wild, semi-alien  flora and fauna.
16. 11 Megaplex. The ruins of a single huge ancient structure stretch for endless miles.
17. 13 Rain forest. Vast, damp, and green.
18. 15 Rolling hills. A stretch of gently rolling hills makes for good agricultural land.
19. 17 Scrub desert. These often appear on the leeward side of mountain ranges. Borders will often be grasslands or savanna.
20. 19 Volcano. One or more mountains in a nearby range are volcanically active. This may be natural or it may be a consequence of Legacy  flux or ancient manipulation.

Generating single Hexes aus  [[202009021431 Filling in the Blanks]]
The system used here assumes that each hex is 6 miles from face to face and is divided into a number of subhexes, each one 1.2 miles face to face. Each 6-mile hex has 1d6 features and 1d6 lairs. As an alternate rule, the Referee can roll 1d4 for both features and lairs when populating desert or grassland hexes, and 1d8 for both when populating jungle and mountainous hexes. 
It is trivially easy to adjust the hex spacing: 5- and 8-mile hexes are two other popular hex sizes. If using sizes smaller or larger than this range, however, it is recommended that you adjust the number of lairs and features accordingly. Smaller hexes should have 1d4 lairs and features, while larger hexes should have 1d8 lairs and features. It is also possible to use this supplement to populate maps that are much less dense, or to generate features on the fly as needed. 
**Likewise, it is possible that the Referee does not want this level of granularity in their game, and chooses to use this supplement to place one feature or lair per hex, rather than placing multiple features and lairs within a hex. If this is the case, it is recommended that the Referee use Table 1.2, below, instead of 1.1**. Additionally, don't roll 1d6 to determine the number of lairs and features per hex; instead, roll 1d20 once, or potentially twice, per hex, depending on how many points of interest are desired. **This supplement assumes that a hex map is generated and filled in with the appropriate terrain before hexes are populated. It does not provide guidance for the creation of an initial hex map**

One-Roll Terrain Feature Details
It can be difficult to add spice to your sixth mountain
range; there are only so many ways to enliven a forest, a
desert, or a pile of rocks before the creative springs run
dry. As a supplementary tool, you can roll one die of each
type and reference the tables below to add more detailing
and character to a given terrain feature.
It’s assumed that the terrain feature is meant to be
a place of adventure and profit, so the table’s results are
canted towards dangerous, enigmatic places. It’s assumed
the bucolic breadbasket regions of your campaign aren’t
in need of particularly exciting features.
A suitably inaccessible region can end up becoming a
“borderland” zone even in the heart of a developed kingdom.
Bandit kings, monstrous hordes, and other grist for
adventure can thus be placed almost anywhere.
