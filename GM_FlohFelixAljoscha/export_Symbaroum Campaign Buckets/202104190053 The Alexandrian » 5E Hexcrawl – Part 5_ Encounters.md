### [5E Hexcrawl – Part 5: Encounters](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46192/roleplaying-games/5e-hexcrawl-part-5-encounters)

April 13th, 2021

[_Go to Part 1_](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46020/roleplaying-games/5e-hexcrawl)

To check for encounters, roll 1d12 once per watch.

A roll of 1 indicates that an encounter should be rolled on the hexcrawl’s wandering encounter table.

A roll of 12 indicates that the characters have encountered a keyed location within the hex as an exploration encounter. Most hexes only have a single keyed location. For hexes with multiple keyed locations, determine the location encountered randomly.

> _Playtest Tip: It’s often effective to do an encounter check for all of the watches in a day simultaneously by rolling 6d12. (See [Fistfuls of Dice](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45834/roleplaying-games/random-gm-tip-fistfuls-of-dice) for tips on interpreting simultaneous dice rolls.)_

**Exploration Encounter**: Exploration encounters only occur during watches in which the characters are traveling or otherwise exploring an area. They do not occur during watches in which the characters are resting or otherwise stationary.

**Wandering Encounter**: A wandering encounter can occur during any watch. (They are usually creatures, whose movement can bring them into contact with the expedition regardless of whether the expedition is on the move or not.)

> _Note: See_ [Hexcrawl Tool: Spot Distances](https://thealexandrian.net/?p=46122) _for guidelines on the distance at which initial Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks should be resolved._

**ADVANCED RULE: ENCOUNTER CHANCE
**

You can vary the probability of having an encounter. The table below shows the probability per watch of different encounter checks and also the chance per day that there will be at least one encounter.

You also need to determine whether or not a keyed location has been encountered. This can be done in one of three ways:

*   Determine it on the same encounter die. (The probability does not have to match the probability of an encounter. For example, you might roll 1d8, triggering a wandering encounter on a roll of 1 or 2 and triggering a location encounter on a roll of 8.)
*   Roll a separate encounter die. (This can have the advantage of simultaneously triggering both an encounter and the keyed location, suggesting that the encounter might happen at the location.)
*   Roll a single encounter check and then check to see if that encounter is the keyed location. (You might build this onto the random encounter table – i.e., results 1-10 on a d20 table might be for the keyed location while 11-20 have the wandering encounters. However, this can make it difficult to modify the encounter table or use different encounter tables while keeping the probability of finding locations consistent.)

| **CHECK** | **PER WATCH** | **PER DAY** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 in 1d6 | 16% | 66% |
| 2 in 1d6 | 33% | 91% |
| 1 in 1d8 | 13% | 57% |
| 2 in 1d8 | 25% | 82% |
| 1 in 1d10 | 10% | 46% |
| 2 in 1d10 | 20% | 73% |
| 1 in 1d20 | 5%  | 26% |

Note that if you’re using some of the advanced rules below that interpret certain wandering encounters as exploration encounters, these will effectively reduce the odds of an encounter happening.

**ADVANCED RULE: LOCATION PROPERTIES
**

Keyed locations may have optional properties that determine how and when they’re encountered.

**On Road/River/Trail**: The location is on a road, river, or trail. Expeditions traveling along the road, river, or trail will automatically encounter the location (unless it’s hidden, see below). Expeditions avoiding the road, river, or trail will usually not encounter the location.

**Visible**: The location is large enough or tall enough to be seen anywhere within the hex. Expeditions entering the hex automatically spot the location. If a rating is given (e.g., Visible 2), then the location can be seen from that many hexes away.

**Hidden**: The location is difficult to spot. When this encounter is generated, make a second encounter check. If an encounter is not indicated on the second check, the location has not actually been found. (If the expedition is in exploration mode, they may instead make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate a hidden location after the first encounter check.)

**ADVANCED RULE: % LAIR
**

The percentage listed is the chance that a creature encountered as a wandering encounter is instead encountered in their lair. If the creature is encountered in their lair, the encounter is considered an exploration encounter.

> _Note: This check functionally generates a new location for the current hex (the lair of the indicated creature type). Over time and thru play, therefore, this encounter system will continue to add new content to your hex key (helping to fill the vast, howling emptiness of a typical hex). The more time the PCs spend in a particular area, the more content will be added to that area._

**ADVANCED RULE: % TRACKS
**

The percentage listed is the chance that a creature’s tracks are encountered (and not the creature itself). Tracks are only found as an exploration encounter.

The tracks may be followed using the Tracker [watch action](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46116/roleplaying-games/5e-hexcrawl-part-3-watch-actions). Tracks are usually 1d10 days old. DMs can determine where the tracks lead (although they’ll usually circle back to the creature’s lair in both directions). See _Hexcrawl Tool: Tracks_ for additional guidance.

> _Note: When generating a wandering encounter, check to see if the encounter is tracks. If it is not, then check to see if it’s a lair. If it is not, then it’s a wandering encounter. Once again, notice that these additional checks will substantially reduce the odds of a night time encounter (when the part is not on the move)._

**ADVANCED RULE: BORDER ENCOUNTERS
**

This percentage, which is listed for either a region or a specific hex (or set of hexes), is the chance in a hex bordering on a different region that the wandering encounter should be rolled on that region’s encounter tables.

This rule is obviously only relevant if you have different wandering encounter tables customized for each region.

**ADVANCED RULE: ENCOUNTER REACTION CHECK
**

To randomly determine a creature’s initial reaction to an encounter, roll 2d6 on the following table.

| **2d6** | **Reaction** |
| --- | --- |
| 2-3 | Immediate Attack |
| 4-5 | Hostile |
| 6-8 | Cautious/Threatening |
| 9-10 | Neutral |
| 11-12 | Amiable |

Obviously, the roll is not necessary if you already know the creature’s attitude. After the initial interaction, assuming hostilities don’t immediately break out, you can use Charisma checks to determine if the creature’s attitude improves, worsens, or stays roughly the same.

> _Note: The outcome of the reaction table is deliberately vague. This is necessary because it can be applied to a wide variety of intelligent, semi-intelligent, and unintelligent creatures, but it’s also expected that the DM will use their creativity and knowledge of the setting to make the general result something specific. A Hostile encounter, for example, might be a group of starving wolves; slavers looking to capture the PCs; or a group of paladins who mistakenly think the PCs are the slavers._

**ADVANCED RULE: SIMULTANEOUS ENCOUNTERS
**

It can be desirable for your encounter procedures to potentially generate multiple encounters in the same watch:

*   It creates uncertainty for the players. (They can’t simply assume that they won’t experience another encounter in the current watch because they’ve already had one.)
*   It can create a dynamic fluctuation in difficulty.
*   The combination of multiple encounters into a single encounter can create lots of different encounters from a relatively simple encounter table. (Are the two encounters allies? In conflict with each other? Is one encounter drawn to the sounds of the PCs dealing with the other encounter? If you generate one encounter at the lair of a different encounter, what are they doing there? And so forth.)

There a few methods you can use for achieving this:

*   Make multiple checks per watch.
*   On a successful encounter check, immediately make a second encounter check. (You can repeat this again if the second encounter check is successful, potentially putting no limit to the number of encounters possible in a single watch.)
*   Incorporate a “Roll Again Twice” or similar entry on your wandering encounter table.

Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages.

> _Note: I, personally, check for a second encounter when the first encounter is successful. This second encounter check might also be for the keyed location of the hex, placing the first encounter there._

**ADVANCED RULE: CIRCUMSTANCE DIE
**

The circumstances of an encounter will be informed by the terrain type, time of day, spot distance, watch actions, and so forth. (Generating an encounter with eight kenku at night while the expedition is resting on the open plains suggests a very different encounter than one with eight kenku in the middle of the day in a dark forest.)

When a particular condition is either pervasive in a region or important to the campaign (but should not be present in every single encounter), a circumstance die can be used to randomly incorporate it.

Examples could include:

*   An Icewind Dale campaign in which there’s a 2 in 6 chance for an encounter to occur during blizzard conditions.
*   A 1 in 4 chance that the demon trapped in a cage formed from one of the PCs’ souls to attempts to assert control.
*   A 1 in 6 chance that the encounter is being watched by a strange, shadowy figure with glowing red eyes.
*   A 1 in 6 chance that the creatures encountered belong to or are working for the Countess Remorzstan (with appropriate brands or work papers).
*   A 1 in 8 chance that the encounter occurs near an outcropping of glowing purple crystals.

Some such conditions might, under other circumstances, be generated through other procedures. (For example, blizzards might be generated through a random weather table.)

**DESIGN NOTE: PROCEDURAL vs. DESIGNED ENCOUNTERS
**

A **procedural encounter** will usually generate one or more general elements. (For example, 1d6 friendly orcs.) As described in [_Breathing Life Into the Wandering Monster_](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7897/roleplaying-games/breathing-life-into-the-wandering-monster), the expectation is that the DM will contextualize this encounter. In other words, the procedural encounter is an improv prompt for the DM to create the encounter (often combined with a simulationist element of modeling, for example, what kinds of monsters lurk in the Darkovian Woods).

A **designed encounter**, on the other hand, is far more specific: You’re essentially prepping the material that you would improvise with a procedural encounter.

The [Principles of Smart Prep](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/39893/roleplaying-games/smart-prep-part-2-the-principles-of-smart-prep) maintain that you generally shouldn’t prep material that can be just as easily improvised at the table, so generally speaking I would describe most designed encounters as being training wheels for DMs who aren’t confident improvising encounters from procedural prompts yet. (There can be a number of exceptions to this, but they’re pretty rare in actual practice, in my experience.)

In my experience, designed encounter tables typically result in a lot of wasted prep. They also get used up (a procedural encounter can be used over and over and over again to varying results; a designed encounter is specific and generally can’t be repeated). This creates gaps in your encounter table and a need to frequently restock them.

(Procedural-based encounter tables will also need to be tweaked or restocked from time to time – if the PCs wipe out the goblin village, it may result in no further encounters with goblins – but this is very rare in comparison.)

    All these hexcrawl articles are really making me want to run a hexcrawl now, but it really wouldn’t fit into my current urban mystery campaign. It makes it seem so straightforward where before it’s seemed like such an intimidating prospect. I’ll have to save my enthusiasm for the next campaign though.

    This ties a whole bunch of good ideas together – nice.
    
    I get why the reaction roll is listed as an advanced procedure, but my ‘crawls really blossomed when I started rolling for reactions more often. Sure, you could say that the hydra is always hungry and always attacks, but rolling can prompt surprising inventions: if “cautious”, maybe it lost several heads to the last party it ate and is leery of fire. If “neutral”, maybe it just gobbled down a paladin and is sunning itself while digesting. If “hostile” but not attacking, maybe it’s guarding hatchlings. I enjoy the surprises as a DM, players seem to delight in unexpected wrinkles to encounters, and when I’m playing they make the world feel more alive. So I think rolling for reactions is a good candidate for the very first “advanced procedure” a DM adopts once they’re comfortable running simple random encounters.

    One tip I’d add to help DMs bridge between designed and procedural encounters is having the D12s pre-rolled and on place where you can tick them off as watches go by.
    
    I find this handy, because I don’t know the exact path my party will take (especially when they could get lost and veer off into different territory), but if I know a “1” is coming up on the d12, I can start to brainstorm the circumstances of that encounter based on their direction. This means that I don’t pause the action to generate the encounter, it gets slotted in more naturally, often as a direct response to one of their actions.
    
    I actually keep travel worksheets for each of region of my map, with evocative words for the region, travel speeds under common conditions, and the random encounter chances for that region (1 in 4 for dangerous woods, 1 in 12 for roads), all pre-rolled so I can tick them off as watches go by.
    
    TY for this awesome series!

    I know the % Lair idea comes from older editions, but where do we pull those probabilities from for 5e? Is that the subject of a later article you’re thinking about, or is there already a source I’m just not familiar with?

    @CritFailsafe: These values are all about how you expect this particular monster to behave. I believe the quick answer is to use the value for similar monsters in 1e.

    Based on your feedback, I’m going to add some additional guidance and a sample encounter table.
    
    @CritFailsafe: The % Lair and % Tracks numbers can be set arbitrarily. For a quick rule of thumb, use Lair 20% (or Nil for animals that don’t really have lairs) and Tracks 40%.
    
    A gamist tip here is to increase the % Tracks value based on difficulty: If there’s a monster that’s a lot more powerful than everything else in the region, crank up the % Tracks so that PCs are far more likely to become aware that it’s there than they are to run into it blindly.
    
    A simulationist tip is to vary both numbers by a sense of the creature’s behavior. Easy example: How likely is a flying creature to leave tracks compared to a woolly mammoth?
    
    A dramatist tip is to think about how interesting each type of encounter is for each creature type. Is a ghoul lair more interesting than running into a pack of ghouls in the wild? Crank up the % Lair. And so forth.

    For a GM who struggles with ad hoc improvisation, a good middle ground may be to use procedural tables, but generate the results during prep. It buys you time to think about the results you rolled, allowing you to practice improvisation without the pressure of a group of players waiting for you to come up with something right now.
    
    The risk of wasted prep is higher (if you have to restock your procedural table, you may have to throw away a prepped encounter), but if you don’t go overboard, the players should run into an encounter in the relevant area eventually, similar to how locations are prepped in a hexcrawl.

    How would you allow for the possibility of finding an \*unoccupied\* lair? (Either in the sense of “abandoned” or “nobody home”.)
