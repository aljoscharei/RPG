Thunder (Long Hammer): 
- qualities 
	- Bastard Weapon
	- Massive(dmg die advantage) [[./resources/201711022038_Advanced_Players_Guide.resources/Symbaroum_-_Advanced_Players_Guide.pdf]], and
		- Precise, (+1 on attack attr.) [[Symbaroum_-_Core_Rulebook.pdf]] p 154) but the negative quality Unwieldy has been removed (value: 500 thaler). 

In addition, the hammer comes with two special abilities for its wielder to make use of:  

Armor Breaker: The master who has bound the hammer to himself/herself may after each attack, successful or parried, attempt to crush the enemy’s metal armor or shield. The attempt is performed like an extra attack – damage is rolled as usual; if the outcome is higher than the armor’s Armor value, the Armor value is permanently decreased by 1d4. If the outcome is 6 or higher the attack renders the enemy’s shield completely useless, forcing its user to throw it away. Armor Breaker can be used repeatedly against the same target.  

Synchronization: If its master has the[[Symbaroum Traits Hammer Rhythm]] ability, Thunder can adopt perfectly to the user’s movements and hit with maximum effect. The synchronization deals +1d6 damage and lasts until the scene ends or the master changes target.
