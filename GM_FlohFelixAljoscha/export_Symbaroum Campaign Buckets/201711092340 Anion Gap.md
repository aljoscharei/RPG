**OVERVIEW**

Anion Gap = Na+ – (Cl- + HCO3-)

*   The Anion Gap (AG) is a derived variable primarily used for the evaluation of metabolic acidosis to determine the presence of unmeasured anions
*   The normal anion gap depends on serum phosphate and serum albumin concentrations
*   An elevated anion gap strongly suggests the presence of a metabolic acidosis
*   The normal anion gap varies with different assays, but is typically 4 to 12mmol/L (if measured by ion selective electrode; 8 to 16 if measured by older technique of flame photometry)
*   If AG > 30 mmol/L then metabolic acidosis invariably present
*   If AG 20-29mmol/L then 1/3 will not have a metabolic acidosis
*   K can be added to Na+, but in practice offers little advantage

**ALBUMIN AND PHOSPHATE**

*   the normal anion gap depends on serum phosphate and serum albumin
*   the normal AG = 0.2 x \[albumin\] (g/L) + 1.5 x \[phosphate\] (mmol/L)
*   albumin is the major unmeasured anion and contributes almost the whole of the value of the anion gap.
*   every 1g/L decrease in albumin will decrease anion gap by 0.25 mmoles
*   a normally high anion gap acidosis in a patient with hypoalbuminaemia may appear as a normal anion gap acidosis.
*   this is particularly relevant in ICU patients where lower albumin levels are common

**HIGH ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS (HAGMA)**

HAGMA results from accumulation of organic acids or impaired H+ excretion

Causes (LTKR)

*   Lactate
*   Toxins
*   Ketones
*   Renal

Causes (CATMUDPILES)

*   CO, CN
*   Alcoholic ketoacidosis and starvation ketoacidosis
*   Toluene
*   Metformin, Methanol
*   Uremia
*   DKA
*   Pyroglutamic acidosis, paracetamol, phenformin, propylene glycol, paraladehyde
*   Iron, Isoniazid
*   Lactic acidosis
*   Ethylene glycol
*   Salicylates

Effects of albumin

*   Anion gap may be underesitmated in hypoalbuminaemia, because if albumin decreased by 1g/L then the anion gap decreases by 0.25 mmol
*   To overcome the effects of the hypoalbuminaemia on the AG, the corrected AG can be used which is AG + (0.25 X (40-albumin) expressed in g/L

Lab tests to consider include:

*   lactate, glucose, creatinine and urea, urinary ketones, serum levels of methanol, ethanol, paracetamol, salicylates and ethylene glycol

**NORMAL ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS (NAGMA)**

NAGMA results from loss of HCO3- from ECF

Causes (CAGE)

*   Chloride excess
*   Acetazolamide/Addisons
*   GI causes – diarrhea/vomiting, fistulae (pancreatic, ureters, billary, small bowel, ileostomy)
*   Extra – RTA

Causes (ABCD)

*   Addisons (adrenal insufficiency)
*   Bicarbonate loss (GI or Renal)
*   Chloride excess
*   Diuretics (Acetazolamide)

Calculate the **urinary anion gap** to differentiate between a GI and renal cause of a normal anion gap acidosis

*   urinary anion gap = (Na+ + K+) – Cl-
    *   _renal causes_ increased urinary HCO3- excretion thus _increased_ urinary AG
    *   _GI causes_ increased NH4+ excretion thus _decreased_ urinary AG

**LOW ANION GAP**

Causes

*   Non random analytical errors (increased Na+, increased viscosity, iodide ingestion, increased lipids)
*   Decrease in unmeasured anions (albumin, dilution)
*   Increase in unmeasured cations (multimyeloma (cationic IgG paraprotein), hypercalcaemia, hypermagnesaemia, lithium OD, polymixin B)
*   bromide OD (causes falsely elevated chloride measurements)

**ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE ANION GAP**

Advantages

*   simple to measure and evaluate acid-base disturbance
*   can be done at bed side

Disadvantages

*   reduced anions (ie hypoalbuminaemia) which is common in critical illness will reduce AG and may mask an elevated AG
*   unmeasured cations such as lithium and hyperglobulinaemia will reduce AG
*   hypercalcaemia and hypermagnesemia will reduce the AG
*   calculation of AG involves the measurement of electrolyte therefore is depends on the accuracy of measurement process.

    Hi Michelle
    Normal pH doesn’t mean there is not an acidosis (there is, a ketoacidosis) but there is not an acidemia (pH is normal).
    This is likely to be because of respiratory compensation (low PCO2 of 15) and possible concomitant metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting.
    Hope that helps
    Chris

    Great article Jeremy. I keep coming back to it over and over over time.
    
    May I suggest a little more “memory friendly” version of the albumin corrected AG formula as AG + (40-albumin/4) as it uses “whole” number rather than a decimal.
