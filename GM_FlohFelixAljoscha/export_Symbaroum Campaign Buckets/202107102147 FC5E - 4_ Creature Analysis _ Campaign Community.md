# 4: Creature Analysis

**Creature Analysis - Finding the Perfect Tool for the Job**
DMs can find dozens of viable creatures in D&D 5E to fit the theme of their adventure. Yet all these options pose a problem.
How do you know what creatures to choose for your encounter?
The answer to this problem is to do a brief creature analysis on your short-list of foes.
This analysis will give you a rough idea if the creature is worth using. As well as how to use them so you can make your three-round combat plans.
In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn how to analyze creatures so we can always find the perfect tool for the job.
**Before We Begin…**
You need a short-list of creatures at your disposal. These creatures should fit the theme of the encounter you are planning.
Start with creating a list of creatures that fit the theme you have in mind.
You should also know what you need out of the list of creatures you’re analyzing. For example:

1.  The BBEG would benefit by adding a few creatures to soak up damage for them while they sit far back blasting the party with spells.
2.  You want to catch the party off-guard with an ambush and need some quick-hitting creatures to lay the trap.
3.  You wish to subdue the party to either capture them or make them easier to kill.

Each of these examples requires a different approach. The creature you select must have specific traits or capabilities to fit the role you need.
As you analyze your list of creatures, you will have a keen eye to spot traits, stats, and actions that fit into the encounter.
**Creature Analysis**
A creature analysis is a succinct summary of your observations.
To make the analysis easier, break up statblocks into smaller chunks. You can analyze these chunks in any order.
**Base Stats**
Think of a creature’s base stats as the bones of their statblock. These enhance the rest of the creature's statblock.
List of Base Stats:

*   AC
*   Ability Scores
*   Attack Bonus/Save DC
*   HP
*   Movement

Base stats are not enough on their own to analyze the creature. Yet, they will give you an idea of their strengths and weaknesses.
For example, if you are in the market for a tanky creature you’ll want a creature with high AC, HP, or both.
The chart on page 274 of the _Dungeon Master’s Guide_ is helpful for comparing the creature’s stats against its CR. Use this to determine how powerful a creature is.
**Resistances, Immunities, Saves, and Skills**
This part of the statblock reinforces the creature's base stats.
Damage resistances and immunities bolster the creature’s HP and survivability. Resistance or immunity to a common damage type is an enormous boon.
Common Damage Types:

*   Acid
*   Bludgeoning
*   Cold
*   Fire
*   Piercing
*   Poison
*   Slashing

Condition immunities can make a creature difficult or outright impossible to crowd control. This allows them to function as normal while the party wastes time failing to subdue them.
For example, a creature that’s immune to paralysis will shrug off a [_Hold Monster_](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hold%20Monster#content) spell. This will consume both an Action from the caster and a 5th-level spell from the party’s arsenal.
Proficiency in saving throws is another bonus to a creature’s defenses.
Skill proficiencies may also assist a creature in combat.
For example, high Perception and Darkvision make a creature a fantastic guard unit. Proficiency in Athletics or Acrobatics is useful for breaking out of grapples.
**Traits**
The traits section of a creature’s stat block is chock-full of flavor. It’s also full of unique features that enhance the creature’s base stats and actions.
Many traits unlock new options for a creature to make. Be on the look-out for traits that give a creature a regular Bonus Action or Reaction. Any boost to a creature’s action economy is fantastic.
Keep in mind, not every trait is useful in combat or in your envisioned encounter.
**Actions and Damage Per Round**
A creature’s actions will reveal everything they are capable of doing in combat.
Begin with calculating the creature’s average damage per round (DPR).
To do so, take a look at the number of attacks they make per turn and add up the average damage for each attack. **CR in 5e is calculated assuming that the creature deals damage every round. Due to that, it's best to use the same assumption for creature analysis as well.**
Average the creature’s DPR over three rounds to get an accurate read-out. Make sure you consider all its attack options because not every creature will use the same Action each round.
Take a dragon, for example. In three rounds they may use their Breath Weapon once and their Multiattack twice.
The more options a creature has (spells, rechargeable actions, etc.), the more varied their per round damage is. Therefore, it's better to take an average between the three.
This also includes out-of-turn damage the creature may deal such as a Legendary Action attack.
You can use this number alongside the chart in the DMG to compare against its CR.
Take a look at what else the creature brings to the table. Utility and crowd control can be more valuable than a high DPR in the right circumstances.
Make note of powerful Rechargeable Actions. These limited-use actions are valuable encounter building tools as we learned in the Three-Round Combat Plan lesson.
**Classify the Creature**
Use your observations to determine the creature’s role. These classifications help determine how to use the creature on a base level.
Here are the classifications that I use based on the [4e Monster Roles](https://dnd4.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_role):

*   Artillery: Ranged attackers with poor defense
*   Brute: High defense with decent melee damage
*   Controller: AoE damage dealers OR creatures that provide crowd/battlefield control
*   Skirmisher: Single-target melee damage with poor defense

**Determine Usage**
Each creature classification paints a picture of how to use the creature in combat.
Artillery should be far behind enemy lines. Their job is to pepper the party with spells and ranged attacks while maintaining a safe distance from the party’s melee attackers.
Brutes are damage soaking units. Use them to create a defensive wall to protect your other creatures. Their high defensives will force the party to spend extra resources, such as Spell Slots, to take them out.
Controllers use powerful AoE damage and crowd control spells to soften up the party for the other creatures.
Controllers will want to keep some distance from the party. However, they can’t always stand as far back as Artillery due to the shorter range of their spells.
Skirmishers should flank low AC characters such as ranged attackers. Have them cleave through the backline while the Brutes and Controllers occupy the frontline.
Traits and features give creatures unique strengths and weaknesses. However, their classification will give you the basic knowledge of how to pilot the creature.
**Example: Creature Analysis of the Ettin**
The ettin’s statblock is [in the SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) or the Monster Manual on pg 132.
**Role:** Brute
**Strengths:** fast, respectable damage, good HP
**Weaknesses:** low AC, no ranged attack options
**Notes:** Two Heads, Wakeful, Darkvision, and their bonus Perception make ettins fantastic guard units.
**Usage:** Based on this analysis, the ettin is a great choice for a frontline tank-type creature. Their traitsand proficiencies also make them great guard units.
Ettins need an enclosed battlefield due to their lack of ranged attack options.
For example, a winding hallway in a dungeon. Ettins can patrol the area, and use their excellent movement to engage the party they’re targeted by ranged attacks.
**With the Analysis Complete, It’s Time to Create!**
Creature analysis is the gateway to choosing the best creatures for your encounters.
A great analysis should be short and sweet. Knowing the basics about a creature will reveal if they are worth including as well as how to use them if you do.
Create a list of creatures based on flavor and trim it with mechanical analysis. In doing so, you will select the perfect creatures for your encounters going forward.

**Worksheet Activity - Analyze Some Creatures!**
**Analyze the following creatures:**
Bugbear (CR 1 Goblinoid)
Wyvern (CR 6 Dragon)
Their Statblocks are [in the SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) or the Monster Manual on pgs 33 and 303.
**Answer Key:**
**Bugbear**
**Role:** Skirmisher
**Strengths:** fantastic ambusher, high first-round damage and decent damage in proceeding rounds, solid AC, and has a ranged attack option
**Weaknesses:** HP is low-ish
**Notes:** Use their +6 Stealth and _Surprise Attack_ to set up a devastating ambush
**Wyvern**
**Role:** Skirmisher
**Strengths:** Fantastic damage, especially when the target fails the saving throw against its poisoned stinger.
**Weaknesses:** Low AC, no ranged attack options, sluggish when unable to fly, easy to crowd control via a Dex or Wis save.
**Notes:** Needs a wide-open area to be effective. Anything that hinders its flying speed is a detriment to the wyvern.
**How To Summary**

1.  Assess the creature’s base stats.
2.  Consider the impact of their damage resistances, condition & damage immunities, and saving throw & skill proficiencies.
3.  Take a look at their traits.
4.  Analyze their Actions and Damage Per Round (DPR).
5.  Classify the creature and consider how to use them based on your observations.
