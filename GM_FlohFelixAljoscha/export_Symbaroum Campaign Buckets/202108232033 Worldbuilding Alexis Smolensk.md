	- the Rules are the physics of the game world. You need to have thought about every Rule before Worldbuilding

	- not Gygax 75, but mostly uninteresting
- [[Worldbuilding 1b Systems.pdf]]
	- Latitudes are convenient lines that designate a distance from the Equator. If the equator is latitude zero and the pole is latitude 90, we can get an idea of what sort of climate we'll get, if we call our imaginary line through our imaginary game world, for each ten points of latitude.
		- Lat.10 is the south edge of the Caribbean, Costa Rica, Ghana in Africa, Ceylon, Philippines. Hot, wet, jungle, tropical ocean.
		- Lat.20 is Mexico City, Yucatan, Haiti, Saharan Africa and Arabia, central India, Burma, Hawaii. Still hot and wet, but with dry seasons and in some places, very very dry.
		- Lat.30 is Texas, Florida, Morocco, the Middle East, the Punjab and the Himalayas, Shanghai. Hot summers, warm winters, large dry areas and lowland swamps, very cold if the mountains are high enough; very populated but few needs for group survival.
		- Lat.40 is Colorado, Illinois, New York, Spain, Constantinople, the Caucasus, Sinkaing, Beijing, Korea, Japan. Warm to hot summers, cold winters, traditional seasons, intensely heavy population, more socially conscious.
		- Lat.50 is Canada, Holland, North Germany, Central Russia, Siberia. Very cold winters, cool summers, high urban population and scattered rural; high need for social cooperation.
		- Lat.60 is Northern Canada, Norway, St. Petersburg, Yakutsk. Non-agrarian, cold, highly cooperative, scant population.
		- Just gets colder and largely unhabitable from there.
	- Ten degrees of latitude equals about 690 miles / 1110 km. 1 degree of latitude = 111 km. If we decide what the central latitude on our map is, and then what we'd like both the most northern and the most southern parts to feel like, we can get a scale on our map.

- [[Worldbuilding 1c Climate.pdf]]
	- Climate dictates what we can grow and eat, what we wear, what shelters we live in, what people do for a living, the state of health, the presence of water and what bugs are in it — and therefore the practicality of possessing property, which fundamentally is defined by water use.
		- **does that mean that there is no use of having land if there is no water to grow things on that land?**
		- Which is why we don't want to go to Aruba or Curacao in the off season. Just to the south, this same trade wind deflects along the coast, or up into the Orinoco valley (which has a microclimate, a much smaller "bowl"), until it skirts the continent or strikes the eastern slope of the Andes in Colombia ... where the water collected by the trades from the Atlantic is dumped, producing a humid subtropical climate.
			- [[Orinoco valley.png]]
		- The central Amazon creates its own humid climate, benefiting froma great deal of ground and surface water, a forest that stabilizes that water and the three trade winds that feed the steady high (warm, thickly piled, energetic air) that sits over the jungle.
		- However, the southern trades do get all the way across South America, again striking the Andes, dropping the very last of their humidity ... creating a desert coastal strip on the west side of South America that runs down Peru and into Chile. The Atacama Desert in north Chile is one of the driest in the world, but it's very small. There's very little land between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean, but it's very dry. This is why the Incas lived in the mountains, and not on the coast.
		- Contrariwise, however, just to the south, the wet westerlies pour across the Pacific and meet the Andes in Chile. That one divergent wind is deflected (so the Atacama gets none of these wet westerly winds), but the remainder dump huge amounts of cold, wet water onto Chile ... similar to how the westerlies in North America rain similarly on Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.
		- Therefore, on the east side of the Andes, in Argentina, the land is quite dry. Not dry in the way of the Atacama Desert, which is further north and therefore gets more hot sun, but dry in the way of Alberta, Colorado and Texas.

	- We have three templates for human habitation of a continent on Earth. I'll start with the least practical for a D&D world, Australia. Australia was settled some 40,000 years ago (though these numbers change all the time, so we could just as easily say 50,000 to 35,000 years ago). At the time of its settlement, humans hadn't developed farming or any sustenance technology beyond hunting and gathering. Australia had some large animals when it was first settled, but these were quickly killed off until none were left; during that time, and afterwards, the aboriginals never developed a sufficient food source to enable the key ingredient advancing civilisation: specialisation. A surplus of food frees a segment of the population from having to produce food, which enables them to specialise in creating new technologies. The first peoples of Australia never got there. Thus, while able to survive in Australia with great expertise, they were easy prey for the monsters, er, Europeans, who arrived and dominated the continent.
	- However, since those horrid events took place on a tiny scale only beginning in 1629, and on a larger scale after 1788, the two historical Australias are nothing like what's wanted for D&D. Primitive Australia has no characteristic that meets the expected technology and time period of D&D, and colonial Australia occurs far too late, in the early industrial revolution. There's not much here.
	- Second template. The natives of the New World came over the land bridge from Asia into the Americas sometime between 11,000 and 15,000 years ago ... after the emergence of farming in Eurasia-Africa. If the land bridge had collapsed a few thousand years later, there's every probability that migrating peoples might have brought rice and wheat seeds with them, which would have radically changed the culture of peoples settling in the New World. However, the peoples who came over were, again, hunters and gatherers.
	- YET, the Americas offered a great deal more than Australia. Corn, beans, peppers and a host of other plants provided a much greater opportunity for the New World to push into their own farming revolution and, ultimately, the creation of specialist classes, particularly priests and soldiers. Disappointingly, however, the New World had no cereal grains comparable with the Old World. While maize will produce an abundance of food, cool temperate climates limit yields and prolong the length it takes to grow corn ... meaning less corn can be produced in a cool climate like the continental United States. Thus advanced cultures like that along the Ohio, the Anastazi and the Algonquin tribal confederation had to rely on other foods like sweet potatoes and beans ... both of which require considerable more time and effort for less food than barley and wheat produces.
	- Thus, while the New World culture progressed technologically, it did so much more slowly than the technological rapid Old World. When the English, French, Spanish and Portuguese began to arrive in the 16th century — the far edge of the "fantasy" time period — they had weapons and scientific knowledge that made them vastly superior to the Old World natives.
	- Still, we have two possible D&D milieus from this. We have a primitive yet practical Aztec, Olmec, Mayan or Inca culture, with limited classes but a potential priest magic that could allow most of the basic character classes from the original AD&D game. And we have a transplanted European civilisation that occupies a small part of a more primitive continent, with food technology, among other things, that they've brought with them.
	- It takes an immense amount of effort to transplant a culture overseas. It took the Europeans two centuries to obtain more than a foothold in most of the world ... with tropical, non- European like places being far more dependent on Europe than a fellow temperate climate like the English and French colonies.
	- Maize, beans and tuber production requires a much more cooperative food-producing society, just as the production of eastern rice does. Castle building, manor houses, personal wealth, private control of land and so on makes little or no sense in such a culture.
		- [[Rice Cooperation.pdf]]
			- _Journal of personality and social psychology_
			- They highlight the high infrastructure costs and intense labour requirement in rice farming, derived from the need to level paddy fields, transplant rice seedling, and create and maintain an irrigation system. Indeed, researchers have estimated that wetland rice farming requires at least twice the amount of labour compared to other crops such as wheat and corn (Buck, 1935; Fei, 1945). Traditional wetland rice farming is only possible by coordinating and cooperating extensively with other rice farmers within a village or across villages (Fei, 1945; Talhelm, 2015; Wong, 1971).

	- As an example, suppose the game world is an "archipelago;" say, fifty continents in various areas ranging from Formosa to the size of Greenland. We can pick any of them as our starting place, simply proposing that other lands are out there, but the characters don't have access to ships, or perhaps the nearest of these other continents is at war with the character's present location.
	- Such a world would have a great emphasis on ships and shipbuilding, on the players eventually owning their own ship to allow free passage to other places. Continents that came close to touching one another would make important trading points, with strategic elements that demanded heavy tolls for ships moving through navigable straits between islands as narrow as 800 yards. Likewise, all the most important cities would be harbours, since sea trade would be vastly more important than land trade. All internal transport of goods would be directed towards getting things to port; just as it's always been with Britain, where no part of the island is more than 72 miles from the sea. An archipelago worldbuild would include 50 Britains, all vying to produce the greatest fleet; but the party need never leave one island, and we need never build more than one, perhaps two, in the first ten years of our worldbuilding. Yet, as the theme for this series argues, while we needn't do the work today, we'd know what work needed to be done in the future. And we'd have plenty of opportunities for creating unique islands that are unimagined to us now, but which we could realise later.

	- Interestin Geographical Ideas
		- narrow channel between land masses
		- Ice age
		- desert everywhere
		- Different parts of the world could have aspects related to all four of these examples. The East Indies have characteristics of the archipelago, and could be twice or three times as large if it stretched across the Pacific. The Australian continent could be five times as big, stretching south to form up with Antarctica. Siberia, detached from the rest of Asia and moved north, could serve as an "ice age" continent. And we could merge Africa and South America together, making a larger desert with a great inland sea following the mid-Atlantic Rift.

	- trade requires travel because "neighbours on all sides who live in the exact same kind of village we do, growing exactly the same crops, with the same number of donkeys"
	- "Obviously it's nice if there's a big city a few miles away, as we can haul our surplus to the big city and use it to ease some of our dearth — which explains why so many people live within a few miles of a city, even if they don't count among the city's immediate population"
	- "The continent of Europe is blessed with many, many small seas. Each of these juts up into the core of the European continent, so that no part of Europe is excessively far from water. Even better, Europe is filled with multiple navigable rivers — the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube, the Vistula, the Elbe, the Guadalquivir, the Loire — that flow out of the interior in every direction, so there's always some easy highway from the darkest corner of Europe that will get products out to the sea and into the hands of paying customers.
	- Unlike, for example, China ... where much of the broad lowland produces the same limited crops, meaning we must travel hundreds of miles to find people growing something else. The coast bulges outwards and is filled with tiny islands that make navigation along the coast dangerous ... while the coast is directly adjacent to the Pacific ocean, with its terrible storms that roll in and drown China's vulnerable shoreline. The large navigable rivers, the Yangtze, the Huang Ho, the Han, the Pearl — all flow in the same direction, providing no easy travel from north to south, only east to west. And they're far apart from each other, unlike the Danube and the Rhine, whose navigable headwaters come close together and encourage trade straight through the middle of Europe. While geographically homogeneous, enabling China to consistently form itself into a large entity with periods of strife, as a matter of trade, China had serious problems. This pushed the giant state to undertake giant solutions, such as the construction of the Grand Canal, more than a thousand years before Europe commenced its own canal building."
	- "trade is the reason people leave home. They don't wander into the dangerous and trackless world as a lark, for vacation or out of yearning to know what's out there. The 13th century world isn't Disneyland. People undertake the risk of travel because they must ... they need things they haven't go, sometimes things they must have to survive. A tiny class of people make a living from this trade, but historically that takes time to happen. The Hanseatic League arises more than seven centuries after the fall of Rome; and itself doesn't experience serious competition until another 250 years pass after its formation. Global trade doesn't happen until long after the time frame of a fantasy medieval game world ... which means most likely that your world won't have any serious form of organised trade, anywhere. Most trade in 8th century Europe is painfully local. By the 11th century, journeys of hundreds of miles are rare; Marco Polo makes his journey to China in the 13th century ... when merchants have just begun to make trips of that length."
	- "Arguably, long trips were being made across the Sahara from the Guinea Coast to the Mediterranean as early as the 10th century; Mansa Musa doesn't make his historic journey from Mali to Mecca until the 14th. Guinea suffered from the same problems as China. Most of what they had was homogenous; gold only had value outside of Guinea, which meant a tremendous trip across the largest desert in the world to get things like iron, salt and cloth."
	- "because it's pretty big, it's a salt water body"
	- "Now, get out your blue pencil or make a blue line that starts at the body of water and runs in a squiggly line, making the line as long as you can. Make the line do "river-like" turns and bends, meaning you shouldn't make it too squiggly. Imagine the water rolling between banks, turning left when it reaches a group of hills, and left when it meets a mountain range, and then back and forth when it settles onto a flat plain. Don't draw in the hills and mountains, just imagine that they're there. Good. Now pick a place along the length of the river, anywhere from its "mouth" — where it reaches the sea — to three quarters of it's total length. Make sure the place you pick is at least one quarter below where the river starts. Make a small circle on the spot.
	- Everything between the circle and the body of water is navigable. Different lengths of the river have different depths, as the river gets larger as it goes along, but all of the river up to your circle allows at least some kind of barge or towboat. The circle you've placed is a TOWN. The head of a river's "waterway" is always the best place for a town, or a city, because this is where the river highway "ends." The Mississippi's headwaters reach Minneapolis, which is why Minneapolis is such a big damn place. Ocean-going vessels can move up the Mississippi as far as Baton Rouge — which is why that place exists. The Dneiper river in Russia is navigable as far as Smolensk. Small craft can navigate the Danube as far as Ulm in south central Germany. The medieval Rhine was navigable to Basel in Switzerland (though there were issues above Strasbourg)."
	- "There are navigational issues along the Danube, at the Iron Gates for instance"
	- "Let's say we started the tributary about halfway along the navigable part. And that we've made the second river navigable for about half as far up river as the first. We can put a little circle at the top of the second river's navigability ... and a circle where the two rivers meet. That's also a great spot for a town. Boats can navigate up from the sea, meet with boats coming down the two rivers, so that no one has to travel the length of the river to get the most out of what's available for trade. This is how St. Louis became so important, and Lyons at the confluence of the Rhone and the Saone. Nizhny Novgorod, at the confluence of the Oka and the Volga, is another great example."

	- ![[River Basin.png]]
		- The above is the largest river basin in the world that (a) has most of its area in a temperature zone, and (b) flows from a land mass that sees snow in the winter. The Amazon, the Congo and the Nile are all larger in area ... but they're predominantly jungle rivers, so most of their basins are impractical for high yield agricultural crops. The Rio de la Plata basin is almost as big, but it also rises in the tropics; much of it's potential arable capacity is also lost. The Mississippi-Missouri basin is nearly all owned by one country; and before 200 years ago, was virtually unexploited by any industrial society. When people talk about America being the greatest country in the world because of "freedom" or the constitution, they're full of shit. They have the biggest garden on the block, stuffed between two big mineral treasure troves — also utterly unexploited before two centuries ago. A fantastic quirk of fate has enabled one political entity to gain hold of the richest, untapped 5% of the world, so it can lord over everyone else that it "deserved" it for "reasons."
		- This works as a template if the game setting features a "transplanted people." If, on the other hand, there'd been easy access to North America 12,000 years ago, allowing transplanted crops brought from the Fertile Crescent and China, along with pre-historic farming-culture settlers, the basin above would have become the same balkanised arrangement of inter-warring states that dominated the European, Asian and African land masses. Prior to European occupation, America was balkanised — by hundreds of individualistic, competitive native tribal groups, competing for territory and hunting privileges. The entity that ousted them and occupied the land was also a composite of dozens of European cultures ... who had agreed to act in concert because, as Bill Murray put it, "... our forefathers were kicked out of every decent country in the world. We are the wretched refuse. We're the underdog. We're mutts!" This cooperation was an 18th century phenomenon, rising out of the Enlightenment, which itself was motivated by the brutal carnage of the 30 Years War ... when two sides decided to have a free-for-all drag out slaughterfest — one based not on territory, or personal power, or a Malthusian lack of resources. Nope, these people decided to kill each other over ideology ... with both sides having been slowly fed for 150 years by a new communication medium, the printing press, which told Catholics to kill Protestants and Protestants to kill Catholics. For reasons. Eight million or so died, possibly as many as 25 million
		- **the edge of a river basin can be a frontier, the River can be a frontier**
			- There's a famous quote from Alexis de Tocqueville, describing the two banks of the Ohio River prior to the Civil War: "On the left bank of the river the population is sparse; from time to time one sees a troop of slaves loitering through half-deserted fields; the primeval forest is constantly reappearing; one might say that society had gone to sleep ... but on the right bank, a confused hum proclaims from afar that men are busily at work; fine crops cover the fields ... on all sides there is evidence of comfort; man appears rich and contented; he works. "On the left bank of the Ohio work is connected with the idea of slavery; but on the right with well-being and progress; on one side it is degrading but on the other honourable."
			- Never mind which side is which; it doesn't matter. Consider instead the possibilities for two cultures to be a mere 200 meters apart and yet starkly, culturally different. De Tocqueville describes such a situation in a world where there's a railroad, a telegraph, photography, newspapers. Take all that away and imagine the situation in a medieval world where no such communication or transportation devices exist. For many game worlds, not even a printing press, so that a witness to the difference can publish a description for even hundreds of other people to read.
			- **A distance of 20 miles, as much as a person could walk in a day, might thus be on the other side of the world, for all the news coming from that place. Is it any wonder, then, that the much smaller basins of the Rhine and the Danube were filled with hundreds of micro-cultures, with individual languages, clothing traditions, means of picking their leaders, eating habits and artistry?**
			- Even if these places all produce the same goods, all possess the same dearth, all have the same homogenous DNA ... the way each group tries to solve the problems of survival, tribal cooperation, threats to their hunting grounds and so on changes how this group is from that group in a real, permanent way that lasts dozens of generations.
			- So in designing the frontiers of our game world, we don't want to just think of separating them by mountains and river banks ... but ALSO by the individual strategies that each culture has hit upon as it's moved forward in time. This one has become more intensely **religious**, that one has hit upon commercial success, this enclave is xenophobic, that one is militaristic, this one is run by a king, that one is run by a Matriarchy, and so on. The characteristics of the land bound by its natural frontiers matter deeply in this!
			- A **commercial** culture can only arise in places where movement and trade are easily accomplished, where lots of customers must travel through the town, such as is true of Antwerp and Constantinople, or on a smaller scale, in Arhus or Cadiz. A **militaristic** culture requires much staple food, to produce many babies, who will be expended in war ... so cultures like this arise out of Sparta, Aragon, Rajasthan. Places that are also naturally harsh and unpleasant, serving as an encouragement for soldiers to be fine with leaving home and plundering the "haves," as they see themselves as the "have-nots." This means getting out the designer's paint brush and adding iron deposits to one hillside, where the people living there will make weapons and armour. We add sheep to another plateau, so the residents will get rich supplying textiles and fine clothing, while making paper and contributing to the spread of learning and perhaps magic use. We add a **fishing ground** to another place and encourage boatbuilding, seafaring and exploration. This place has fine, unusual groves of rosewood and hornbeam, encouraging the creation of musical instruments, furniture and other fine crafts, with artistic traditions and the spread of pacifism. This place is blessed with kaolin, from which they make porcelain and again, another artistic tradition rules over the place. That place has deposits of tin and copper, encouraging metallurgy, fine instruments, scientific studies, universities. 
			- And on the flip side, the "have-nots." Regions that have nothing of note, except lots of babies and bitterness; or sub-groups who are refused the privilege of participating, who must instead re-invent themselves as traders and wanderers. **Mercenaries** who work for hire. Foreigners who come in and will take the lowest jobs, because they're the only ones who will do that work. Familiar themes that reflect the real world ... but not everyone is born atop a gold mine. Not everyone's home is adjacent to rich bottomland. Not everyone has something to trade. But everyone, everyone, has dearth ... and if they are to survive, they will do whatever they must.
			- So in setting up our frontiers, and our "nations" within the boundaries created by mountains, rivers and whatever other topographic boundaries there are, stratification matters as well. Most societies, particularly those in the pathways of trade, aren't homogenous.

	- Tolkein was very good at a great many things; and his artwork of Middle Earth is oh-so-fanciful and compelling, but one thing Tolkein was NOT is a geographer. Nor did he give a damn about becoming one. That's obvious from every page of every description of every physical feature he presents in his writings.
	- It's painfully obvious the map was made to impose days of travel upon players through empty countryside, where some of these hexes are hundreds of miles from the nearest place where a farmer might sell grain, so the players can get to the next dungeon. And that is the point. The world isn't made to be a "world." It's made as a measuring tool between dungeons. So it doesn't matter what anyone does here, or how any of it fits together politically, or any other element of sociology, anthropology, meteorology or geography.
	- Forests form when the atmosphere transports warm, wet air over a cool, elevated continent — such as the northern trade winds gathering air from the Pacific as they move east so they can dump rain on the east side of the Nanling highlands all over southern China. Or the way those same winds gather air from the Atlantic and dump it up and down the Appalachians, especially from the Carolinas south.In China, those winds eventually strike the Qinling Mountains, 22,000 feet or so, losing all of their water in the form of snow, so they have very little left to drop on the arid Tibetan Plateau; whatever moisture might remain in the atmosphere is left on the Kunlun Mountains, on the north edge of Tibet, and so there's none at all for the bone dry Takla Makan.
	- In Georgia and Carolina, the Appalachians aren't very high; and the trade winds rolling through the Gulf of Mexico skirt around the mountains and into the Mississippi basin. There the warm wet air meets cold dry air coming down from Canada — and where the two air masses meet, they create spectacular amounts of energy in the form of thunder storms and tornados. "Tornado Alley" forms a NE-SW line that lies just behind the Appalachians. The overall result is a wavering front rolling north and south, dropping inconsistent but sufficient rain for farming from north of Edmonton down into Texas. We rarely get tornados in Alberta, but they happen; caused by the same phenomenon that causes tornados in Kentucky.
	- This is why southern China is thick with jungle like mixed broadleaf and deciduous forests, while the north of China is dry. These are not diddly patches of forest, either; they are a thousand miles in diameter, north to south, east to west, all along the coast and up into the highlands of Yunnan. In America, the thick forests make jungles in Florida and mixed pines and deciduous forests on the Appalachians, and a huge deciduous forest that reaches from Alabama to Wisconsin.
	- Name any place in the world where winds blow from the sea onto the land that isn't drenched in forests.
	- Consider: the Sahara desert has two thousand miles of coastline upon the Atlantic Ocean. Yet it's so dry, the shore of the Sahara is as destitute as any other part. Why? Because at the Sahara's latitude, the trade winds blow west, not east. Those trade winds have to cross the whole African continent before reaching the Sahara on the eastern boundary; and before they can do that, they have to climb over the very high Ethiopian plateau — a geologic extrusion of the earth's crust associated with the African Rift Valley, where tectonic plates are moving apart.
	- If the winds in temperate Greyhawk came from the west, the map above would be a complete desert. If they blew in from the east, the map would be a single monstrous forest, like China and America. BOTH of which would be more interesting than the huge replication of parkland Wisconsin that's represented on a grand scale.
	- Woodlands, steppe, jungles, savanna, deserts and so on aren't topographical features, though fantasy maps treat them as though they are. Forests aren't a kind of mountain; a grassland isn't a kind of sea. These are vegetations that have taken advantage of physical formations and the climate, which dictate how much water they will have upon which to thrive. No water and we get a desert. Very little water and we get an arid highland, like the American Chapparal, or a semi-desert basin, like eastern Oregon. A little more water and we get a breadbasket like Kansas or the Ukraine. A little more water and we get pine trees and aspens; a little more and we get oaks and elms. WATER dictates vegetation, not "where a forest would look good" on a map

- [[A Conclusion to Worldbuilding.pdf]]
	- If you want to write sth. that you don't feel like: set aside some time a day to get it done.
	- "This is painfully naive and juvenile, but it's also highly tenable for anyone not especially familiar with the world — like children — who are seeking a simple, practical structure upon which to run a game world.  The adventures essentially write themselves, are easily comprehended, produce escapist results and — when the adventure is concluded — leave a feeling of warmth and accomplishment.  This feeling can also contribute to the death of a campaign, as it has a "finished" aspect that suggests, "Why not quit while we're ahead?", but this feeling can be overcome by quickly pointing out another really bad apple that needs removing.  One that's even worse than before."
		- This is [[Ruins GM Index]]
	- "Understand **geography**.  This does not mean reading a text book on the subject.  It means reading 30 textbooks on the subject, and then commentary on the text books, and then commentary on the commentary.  These books must describe physical geography, yes, and geology also, but what's wanted are books about political, historical and economic geography.  All these books exist.  And for many, they are dull, inflexible and hard to equate to gaming or why we'd want a map. I wrote many posts emphasising the importance of this information and its application, and yet I think most people will never read enough of it to produce the tipping point of, "Ah, I understand, that's cool."  Which takes awhile.  Critically, understanding the Earth's appearance, structure and behaviour is a self-gift that keeps on giving, not only for role-playing but for every other aspect of life."
