Watch routines compare 

We recommend the following sequence for moving characters on the Regional Map. The 24-hour day is divided into **six watches, each lasting four hours**. The first watch begins at midnight and ends at 4 a.m., and so on.  So auch bei [[202202072058 Alexandrian Hexcrawl MOC]], auch hier ist die Watch 4h.

1. Weather Generation

At the beginning of each watch, the GM generates the weather using the weather table (page 58). This is reported to the players, who record it in their journal or log.

2. encounter Generation

The type of encounters possible depends on the terrain being crossed. The GM determines if the players will have any encounters during the watch. If encounters are scheduled, the GM rolls 1d8 for each to determine in which half-hour of the watch they will occur and 1d30 if the exact minute is required. The GM tells the players of encounters only when they actually occur.

3. movement

The GM asks the players in which direction they wish to travel. Using the Movement Rates table, the GM then estimates how far the party can travel, either until the next encounter or the end of the watch, whichever comes first. He should then move the party on his map, describing as necessary the terrain crossed. Once all business arising from record-keeping, player mapping, and encounters has been dealt with, steps 1–3 are repeated for the next watch.

movement table

Movement rates are at GM discretion. The table is merely a guide. **Rates are given in leagues per watch**, which is approximately equal to **Km/hour**. A Hârnic League is 2.5 miles (4 Km). Five leagues equal one hex on a regional map.

The table lists movement rates for vegetation types under three topography classes. Foot means walking at a steady pace, horse means walk/trot when mounted, and cart or wagon rates assume average loads and draft animals. Generally, pack animals move at the Foot rate.
