**Hit and Run Tactics**
Combat often devolves into a congealed mob of melee creatures smacking each other. This becomes monotonous and tedious for melee combatants.
By leveraging 5e’s rules for breaking up movement we can employ hit and run tactics to break up this "mob" play-style.
Plus, this movement enables you to take advantage of your surroundings.
**Risk vs. Reward of a Hit and Run**
A hit and run is a tactic where a creature makes an attack and then moves.
One benefit of this tactic is the ability to deal damage while moving. This allows you to set up a kite or leverage the battlefield.
For example, attacking and then moving behind cover.
Another benefit is that creatures with unique movement types can attack and position to avoid melee combatants. This bolsters their survivability and lowers the party’s damage output.
However, there is a substantial risk involved in hit and runs because the creature triggers an Opportunity Attack when leaving each opponent's Reach.
These additional attacks increase the party’s action economy and damage output.
**Mechanics Used in a Hit and Run**
The Opportunity Attack (PHB 195) is the most important mechanic to consider during a hit and run. Here's a summary of the mechanic:
When a creature you can see moves out of your Reach you may use your Reaction to make a single melee attack against them. The attack occurs before they leave your Reach.
There are conditions that prevent triggering an Opportunity Attack:

*   Taking the Disengage Action before moving
*   Teleporting out of reach
*   Being moved out of Reach against your will

Creatures that can take the Disengage Action or attack with a Bonus Action have an innate advantage to performing this tactic. They can attack, disengage, and leave without sacrificing their action economy.
The Flyby trait is a specific trait that prevents triggering Opportunity Attacks when the creature flies out of an enemy’s Reach. It’s a unique trait for some flying creatures such as the Owl
[(SRD 385)](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf).
**The Goals of a Hit and Run**
As with any tactic, you need to have a goal in mind when using it. Hit and runs are adaptable to a wide variety of situations to meet many different goals.
For example:

1.  Leaving the enemy’s Reach
2.  Kiting
3.  Moving behind cover
4.  Regrouping
5.  Retreating

While a Dash Action accomplishes the same goals. Hit and runs let the creature continue attacking while they move toward their goal.
This allows you to continue applying pressure to the enemy.
**Variant 1: Attack, Move**
This variant is often used by melee creatures who begin their turn within their enemy's Reach.
At the start of their turn, the creature attacks their opponent.
Next, they’ll move out of the enemy’s reach and proceed toward their goal.
**Variant 2: Move, Attack, Move**
Creatures that can’t attack their target at the start of their turn often use this variant.
Ranged units use this tactic to move into line of sight, attack, and move away.
One example of this is to duck out from cover, shoot, and get behind cover again.
Melee units may need to move into Reach to attack first. Once they attack, they leave the opponent's Reach and move toward their goal.
Melee fliers with flyby naturally use this variant. They’ll swoop down from their starting position, attack, and fly away.
**Variant 3: Bait**
Another variant is to use a creature to bait out enemy Reactions.
Creatures and Player Characters (PCs) have one Reaction per round.
Therefore, if a PC makes an Opportunity Attack on the bait creature, they cannot make another this round. By baiting out PC Reactions, the foe's allies can safely reposition later in the round.
A tank creature with high AC or HP makes for perfect bait. Their high defenses allow them to trigger multiple Opportunity Attacks per turn without fear of dying.
You can also sacrifice weaker creatures, like minions, as bait. This allows your higher-value creatures to reposition throughout the round without fear.
**When Not to Use This Tactic**
Multiple Opportunity Attacks in a row is one scenario where a hit and run is not ideal.
This is because each attack translates to potential damage taken by your creature.
Opportunity attacks increase the opposition’s action economy as well. The more attacks your creature provokes, the higher the risk.
Three or more Opportunity Attacks is a substantial damage increase for the enemy.
Low AC creatures are always at a high risk of being hit. Therefore, each Opportunity Attack triggered is extra risky.
A low HP creature is better off Disengaging to avoid Opportunity Attacks or Dashing to gain more ground.
Ergo, an Opportunity Attack killing your low HP creature is a waste of resources when you have these other options.
**Example: A Run-in With a Giant Owl**
The party has reached the edge of the forest, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead in the night.
Perched 40 ft. up in a tree at the entrance is a giant owl ([5e SRD pg 377](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)), guarding her nest. She views the party as a threat and is waiting to ambush them.
The owl will use the following hit and run tactics:
**Turn 1

Turn 2

**
Keep in mind that she has flyby and therefore does not provoke Opportunity Attacks when flying out of the party’s Reach.
**Keep Up the Pressure**
Hit and run is a fantastic option for applying pressure while repositioning. With its many variations, it’s a tactic that suits many scenarios.
When performing a hit and run, keep in mind your unit’s starting position. This will determine their movement pattern to reach their goal.
Always consider your creature’s health and defenses. After all, a hit and run is not a wise option for creatures who are on death’s door.

Plan at least two hit and runs for the goblins ([5e SRD pg 315](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)) shown on the map below. Each square is 5 ft.
Hint: Goblins have a Bonus Action that will come in handy!
