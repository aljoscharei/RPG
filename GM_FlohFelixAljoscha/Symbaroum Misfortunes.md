| Camp                                           | The characters find an abandoned camp site. Is it truly abandoned? Is there any valuable equipment left behind, or something dangerous?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Corpse                                         | The characters come across the remains of a dead fortune-hunter who was not prepared for the challenges of Davokar. What killed her? Do the characters recognize the deceased?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Bad omen                                       | The characters encounter signs indicating a clear and present danger. What kind of signs – footprints, cadavers, mucus, blood? And how fresh are they?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Sidden silence                                 | Suddenly the forest holds its breath and a dense silence falls over the expedition. Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Stuck                                          | One of the expedition’s carts or part of their equipment gets stuck, in mud, in a crack or under a falling giant tree. It takes two people, each of them rolling a test against Strong, to remedy the situation. If one of the tests fails, the company will travel ten kilometers shorter this day; if both tests fail, it takes a whole day before they can continue forth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Shadowed                                       | The expedition is being followed, which can be noticed with a test against Vigilant. Who is spying on them, and with what intent?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Thorns                                         | The expedition stops at the edge of a vast field of dense thorn bushes. They can go around, thereby cutting the day’s traveling distance in half. If they try to force their way through, all members must roll two tests against Discreet – each failure deals 1d4 damage (ignoring Armor).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Mosquito swarm                                 | During the day’s walk, the characters are harassed by a swarm of mosquitos. What they don’t know is that the insects are exposing them to a disease. See rules on Disease in Symbaroum (page 169 in the Monster Codex) and roll 1d6 – 1–3 Weak Disease; 4–5 Moderate Disease; 6 Strong Disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Downpour                                       | A strange, icy rain hammers down on the forest and the expedition is soaked. The characters can choose to test Strong or Resolute; a failure means that the person catches a chill and suffers –3 to all success tests until he or she gets warm by sitting close to a fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Lost                                           | The characters have to admit that they have lost their bearings. As usual, the guide rolls one Orientation test per day, but with a –5 modification. If failed, the group wanders in circles and makes no progress at all; if successful, they progress at normal speed. It takes three successful tests with a –5 modification before they escape the bewildering area and hence are free from the negative modification. What makes the terrain so difficult to navigate?                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Sick animal                                    | The animals of the expedition seem exhausted and throw up all they eat. A character with Beast Lore can help them by successfully rolling a Cunning test – one test per day and animal. If the company travels with one or more sick animals, they only move a quarter of the normal distance. Maybe they have to leave some animals behind?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Marshland                                      | Suddenly, the characters reach a vast marshland which will take half a day to circumvent. If they choose to proceed, the guide must roll a Vigilant test; if failed, a random expedition member starts to sink and one of the others must pass two Strong tests to save him or her. If three tests fail before two successes are rolled, the unlucky one disappears into the muck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Ambush                                         | Hostiles in the area are planning to ambush the characters, which may be noted with a [Vigilant –5] test. Who is the enemy and what is its goal?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Spoiling food                                  | The characters discover that something has consumed some of their supplies while they were sleeping or traveling, or the provisions are attacked by aggressive microbes which cause part of the stock to rot. The expedition loses 1d20 rations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Wildfire                                       | Without warning, a wildfire spreads toward the expedition at an alarming rate. Each person must pass two Quick tests to reach a safe location. Anyone who fails one or more tests takes 1d4 damage for 1d4 turns (ignoring Armor) before getting to safety; note that they cannot stop and try to extinguish the flames before then. What happens to the pack animals and/or the contracted carriers?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Discord                                        | The strenuous journey is starting to get on peoples’ nerves. Two non-player characters in the expedition start fighting violently. What has happened? Is one of them infected by something?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Tabooed grounds                                | The ground that the characters are traversing is considered taboo for strangers by the local population – the trespassers must die! Who lives in the area? Why the taboo?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Corrupted soil go around or d4 temp corruption | The environment suddenly feels twisted and sick; soon it can be seen, on the dark veins and black leaves of the vegetation. The area is blight-stricken; the characters can turn back and choose another way (loses one day), or they can proceed and roll a Strong test each – a failure means they suffer 1d6 points of temporary corruption that do not leave the body until they have left the corrupted area behind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Sabotage                                       | During the night, a lone saboteur tries to access the expedition’s members, provisions and/or animals. Who is the saboteur? What is the target? Can the characters thwart the attempt?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Delirium                                       | The characters start hearing and seeing what isn’t there; horrifying figures connected to their own history. If a character openly questions what he or she sees and hears, they can roll a [Resolute –3] test; success means that the hallucinations subside. The Game Master decides how much time passes before the group can resume the journey. Is the delirium caused by something they have eaten, or by something in the air or water?                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Permanent corruption d6                        | Everything in the area is dead or twisted beyond recognition. This place is horribly corrupt; even if the characters decide to turn back and go around (losing one day), they must pass a Strong test or suffer one point of permanent corruption. If proceeding and failing the Strong test, they suffer 1d4 points of permanent corruption; should the test succeed, they are instead plagued by 1d6 temporary corruption that lingers all day. In both cases, all provisions are automatically infected – each ration consumed deals one point of temporary corruption that does not go away until the afflicted has eaten pure food for a week. |
| Disappearance                                  | An expedition member (character, companion or animal with supplies) suddenly disappears, as if evaporated into nothing. Was it transferred to another place, time or world? Who or what caused the disappearance, and why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Crazy 1d10 permanent corruption                | A member of the expedition encounters something that makes him or her crazy (bug bite, spores, foul air or similar). Select a non-player or player character at random, who then must roll a Resolute test: the character suffers 1d4 permanent corruption if the test is successful, or 1d10 if it fails. Irrespective of which, the victim will attack the closest person with the intent of killing him or her – a state that remains for the duration of the scene.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Panic                                          | All who travel the area feel as if they are being watched by the forest itself, as if it is assessing them, searching for weaknesses. Suddenly the feeling gowns many times stronger, threatening, like the whole world  is out to get them. All who fail a [Resolute –5] test are struck by panic and start fleeing in different directions. The panic persists for 1d4 hours, and during that time the expedition members become scattered, alone in the depths of Davokar…                                                                                                                                                                       |

|                               |                            | Thick swarms of buzzing, biting, and stinging insects beset the characters from all corners. The bugs get in eyes, ears, hair, mouth. Masses of centipedes writhe around their feet and wriggle into their boots. They swarm so thickly that characters lose sight of each other and stumble into bogs and brambles. They buzz so loudly, characters must bellow to be heard above the cacophony. They may be hidden from or driven off for a few moments, but each time they return more persistent than before until the characters escape the ring. temptations: Shrines, set along the path, each depicting an effigy of one of the Sisters worshipped in the Flocculent Cathedral. Each treasure-hunter should describe the Sister who is a patron saint of their occupation in a sen-tence or two when her shrine is discovered. They may give her a name or sim-ply call her “The Holy Mother of [Occupation].” Take note of their descrip-tions.
