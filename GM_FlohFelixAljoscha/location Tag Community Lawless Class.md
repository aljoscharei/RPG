Some class of citizen is either tacitly or explicitly above the law. They may only be subject to punishment for crimes against their own kind, or they may be entirely immune to legal prosecution. In some cases, this immunity may be the product of official indifference rather than high status; some untouchable classes may be considered so lowly that their slaughter of each other isn’t worth punishing unless it inconveniences their betters.

5.  E  Professionally immune provocateur, Cruelly indulgent elite, Grasping mercantile oligarch
    
6.  F  Hapless magistrate, Avenger outside the law, Victim of an unpunishable crime
    

C The lawless themselves enforce the law, The immune are most dangerous to each other, Special servants of the immune also are immune

T Wealth stolen from a hapless victim, Evidence that an abuser is not legitimately part of the class, Token that grants the bearer the same immunity

P Courtroom where some cases are swiftly dismissed, Site of a gaudily obvious exercise of immunity, Shop where the business was ruined by their excesses
