![[Gallows Pass.png]]

This narrow mountain route has been worn into the rock from thousands of pilgrims making their way through this awe-inspiring territory. Some sections of the path have small alcoves for the dead carved into the rock. Huge statues are carved partially into the mountainside, many half sunk in the ground over time. Their origins are disputed. Some claim them to predate the Old Empire, while others speculate they were erected during one dynasty or another.

Much of the path is below the tree line, and gray, leafless trees weather the winds that cut through the mountains and canyons, stirring many ropes hung from their branches. Once, pilgrims would hang offerings from them, but the cold howling winds and the bare rock and trees cast them in a different light—one that’s given the pass its name.

The weather on the path is fickle and avalanches, inclement weather, and the occasional disappearance or overgrowth of the path itself makes it hard to traverse. Numerous forks in the path lead towards shrines, sacred springs, caves, and the like. Many such sites can be found here for those hardy enough to reach them.

Even now, pilgrims can still be found traversing this isolated path—though these days, few and far between. Besides travelers, there are few other people who live in the area—the occasional reclusive ascetic, shrine attendant, or goatherd. The area is too barren, and requires resources to be brought in from outside.
