These foul sites are cloaked in mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your constant companion.
