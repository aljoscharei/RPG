The court’s prior leadership was recently decimated by age, sickness, misadventure, or political executions, leaving many leadership posts in the hands of much younger, less experienced members. Few of them have a firm grasp on practicalities, and they’re acting with a confidence and boldness that may not necessarily be justified by their actual skills.

E Reckless spare heir turned ruler, Upstart using a role purely for their personal advantage, Outside rival pouncing on their untested leadership

F Harried senior advisor who is ignored, Baffled new ruler who doesn’t understand how it works, Idealistic new office-holder with big dreams

C The new generation is being held back by ossified existing members, They have magnificent plans that will fail spectacularly, They didn’t want the jobs but were forced into them by circumstances

T Lost treasure or resources the old guard hid, Ceremonial regalia that imbues legitimacy, Secret plans or archives that the former ruler hid

P Newly-remodeled court residence, Audience hall adorned with freshly-changed arms, Ministerial office full of confused and harried clerks
