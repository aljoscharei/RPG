Some rival or outside power is making demands on the court that they cannot easily ignore. It might involve some prior offense in need of reparations, a past deal that’s come due, or a price required for a favor that the court desperately needs. These demands are more than the court can easily pay, and determining where the burden will fall most heavily is a matter of fierce internal politics.

5.  E  Scheming shifter of burdens, Outside rival bent on beggaring the court, Incompetent diplomat who’s only making things worse
    
6.  F  Victim of unfair exactions, Harried diplomat with no cards to play, Native who desperately needs the deal to go through
    

C The exactions demanded are purely punitive, There’s a specific temporary reason the court has to acknowledge the demands, Another party could give a better deal if they were persuaded

T Huge down payment on the demands, The precious object the court is trying to acquire, Proof that the demands are unjustified

P Diplomatic retreat full of tense people, Site of the problem causing the demands, Hushed court hall full of whispers
