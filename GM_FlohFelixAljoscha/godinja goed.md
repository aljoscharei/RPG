- open to ambirans, elvish blood, Mask makers. Former ruling class of Symbaroum
Many of the masks carried by barbarians are made by the craftsmen of clan Godinja. Its proud people claim to be the descendants of old Symbaroum’s ruling elite – a belief that members of the other clans question, but without indignation. Instead outsiders point to the fact that the Goeds up until a couple of generations ago were closely associated with the elves of Davokar. And they are happy to echo the rumor stating that Godinja’s clan chieftain, the mighty Vikomer [[Vikomer Häuptling Godinja.jpeg]] , has elf blood coursing through his veins.
