This elixir is made from a decoction of a purple Lily of the Valley, a flower whose cleansing properties and resistance to Corruption were discovered by the witches of Davokar long ago. Purchasing the elixir is expensive, because the ingredient is so rare and few alchemists are skilled enough to brew it. The elixir has no effect on permanent Corruption or on blight-marks which have already appeared on the user.

• Weak:This potion removes 1 temporary Corruptionfrom the soul.

• Moderate: The elixir immediately removes 1d4 temporary Corruption.

• Strong:This version removes 1d8 temporary Corruption.
