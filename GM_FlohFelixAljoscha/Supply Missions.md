SUPPLY MISSIONS

Supply missions are about sourcing material things or occasionally trading mercenary work for wealth and resources.

In a supply mission, ask: What is the supply physically? If it’s a big item, how will they get it back to camp? If it’s wealth, how does that wealth get traded for other things?

Mission objectives could be assets to reclaim (such as carts or goods left out in the field, or caches of weapons secreted away in the past). Sometimes it’s mercenary work (clearing out undead, or fighting other humans), finding something someone values highly (a noble’s paintings in a villa overrun by undead), or protecting someone during travel. It’s often not glorious work, but the Legion recovers and grows through careful allocation of supplies.

For mercenary work, always come through with the payment. The game is hard enough as it is, don’t short the payment unless the actual playthrough of the mission is just getting paid.

supply mission types

These missions are mostly about how you acquire the supplies that the Legion needs.

- Scrounge or Trade: A valuable resource must be recovered, or can be traded for with another group. Many of these missions can be social.

- Rescue Supplies: A source of supplies has fallen into enemy hands, or is guarded by undead, but can be liberated.

- Mercenary Work: A person or group wants to hire the Legion for a job in exchange for wealth and materiel.

rewards

Supply missions provide either supply, assets, or both. See Mission Rewards (page 322) for more details.

penalties

Supply missions have the most variable severity of penalties, but may cost supply or morale when failed or not completed. See Mission Penalties (page 323) for more details.
