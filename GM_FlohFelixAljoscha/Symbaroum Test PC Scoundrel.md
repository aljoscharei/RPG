  - name: Backstab
    desc: "Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with a melee weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. You must be proficient with the weapon used. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another en- emy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t inca- pacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Backstab column of the Scoundrel table."

    desc: "Like your former master, you are used to bearing Corruption as you seek power. When you make a Corruption check, you have advantage on the d20 roll. Note: this is for the initial roll to determine if you gain a mark of Corruption, not the roll to determine the mark’s nature."
