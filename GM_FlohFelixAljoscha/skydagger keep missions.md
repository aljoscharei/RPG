![[skydagger keep.png]]

Skydagger Keep is named after its tall spire jutting into the sky. It’s walls guard the only pass through the Westwall mountains. It is the only thing standing between the Broken hordes in Aldemark and passage into Barta and the Eastern Kingdoms. The Legion has a few precious hours before the bulk of the undead bring their numbers to bear—hours that must be spent readying the old, unused keep to hold a sizeable force amidst the bitter, biting cold.

The keep has some Orite tricks bolstering its old but solid Bartan construction. Pipes carry hot water through the halls, and walkways inside the walls provide movement even when early snows bury the gates and the walls above. Windows hiding under eaves provide a crisp view of the approaching enemies. Vantage points high up give a good angle for siege weapons, for those brave enough to endure the cold to use them.

It’s a good bastion, but the undead are many. And tireless. And driven by unholy power...



ENDGAME

There are six objectives that need to be completed before the Keep can hold against the undead during the winter months. Most of these play out as a series of short, one-obstacle missions. Each mission occurs at approximately the same time, so Specialists and squads can only be assigned to one mission each. The Commander decides in what order the missions will be played out, the Marshal determines who is assigned to which, and the Quartermaster decides what resources are assigned to each task.

MISSIONS

There are five objectives that need to be completed before the final wave of undead assaults the keep. Skip or fail any of these, and tremendous risks will make it almost impossible to keep the Eastern Kingdoms from being overrun. While there’s not a required order to complete them, it’s recommended that the Legion tackle them in the order presented below:

- Reinforce the ramparts and gates. Skydagger has not been maintained in decades, and has never been besieged. Start a 10-segment Long-Term Project, and assign a Specialist and a squad to it. Roll once before each other mission. Add +1d to each roll for each Laborers squad the Legion has.

- Hold the lower pass. One squad and up to three Specialists must hold the pass. If they manage to hold off three enemy units and an Infamous, the mission is complete. This counts as an assault mission. If any Broken has been defeated already, you need not do this mission.

- Stop the main force. Assign one squad and two Specialists to a dangerous recon mission that involves climbing the mountain passes and evading undead patrols. The objective is to start an avalanche to stall and stagger the main undead force.

- Assemble the siege weapons. There are a few underground routes to siege weapon positions on the cliffs above. Nobody knows if the undead have sent more nimble units to reach them overland, or what might be nesting amidst the tunnels. Assign one squad and two Specialists to this supply mission. Take +1d to the engagement roll if the Legion has Siege Weapons. Otherwise, you must repair the old, unused ones on the cliffs.

- Hold the second wave. Fight off a Lieutenant and its undead at the walls. Your Chosen will take the field (make a 10-clock for the Chosen and the Lieutenant as they clash). The undead will attempt to scale the walls and get in. If the ramparts and gates mission is complete, add +1d to your engagement roll. Assign one unit and up to three Specialists.

Then there is one last roll: 
THE LAST WAVE

This is it. A Broken assaults the wall and the keep must hold. This is the last wave of this campaign, and it’s resolved as a fortune roll, to see how the Legion weathers it.

Assemble the dice based on the following:

429

- The Survivors: Always start with 1d for making it to the final wave.

- TheChosen:Take+1difyourChosenisstillaliveandwiththeLegion.

- The Prepared: Take +1d for each Siege Weapon the Quartermaster has.

- The Resourceful: Take +1d if the Legion has both a Mercy and Alchemist.

- The Brave: Take +1d if you lit the fires at Kevala.

- TheBlessed:Take+1difsomeoneintheLegioncanweavemoonlight.

- The Angry: Take +1d if the Legion has Fire Oil.

- TheGodslayers:Take+1difyoucanringabelltoendBrokenpower.

- The Graverobbers: Take +1d if you have the head or chain of a past Chosen.

- The Warded: Take +1d if the Legion carries an Old Empire warding stone.

- The Weary: Take -1d if Legion morale is 3 or less.

- Enemy at the Gates: Take -1d if you have 3 or fewer time remaining.

- The Endless Foes: Take -1d for each Infamous left alive (refer to the lists for each Broken in your game).

- The Crumbling Defenses. Take -1d for every incomplete or failed Skydagger Keep mission (see left).

Your final totals are affected as follows:

- Poor (1-3, -30 points to final score): The Legion is hard-pressed to survive the winter, much less against the undead.

- Bitter (4/5, -10 points to final score): The Legion may hold, but this will likely be their last stand.

- Victors (6, no modifiers to final score): The Legion is well prepared to hold the keep, and will have strong footing when it’s time to do so.

- Legends (critical, +10 points to final score): The Legion scores a massive victory and the undead are cautious to challenge them again.
