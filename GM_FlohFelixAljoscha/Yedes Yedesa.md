- sedentary Leonods fortress
Compared to their northern neighbors, the Yedes actually have better reasons for being proud. Of the last ten High Chieftains six have been fostered by clan Yedesa, includ- ing the current one. The reason for this may be that the clan long ago abandoned a nomadic lifestyle, in favor of a few permanent settlements. Since the annihilation of clan Jezora, chieftain Leonodâ€™s stone fortress is clearly the most impressive construction of the barbarian people.
