## Hit Points

- [ ] At less than half HP, show signs of wear (cuts and bruises).
- [ ] INSTANT DEATH: If reduced to 0 HP and damage remains, you die if remaining damage >= your HP maximum.
- [ ] 0 HP: If damage reduces you to 0 HP but fails to kill you, you fall unconscious and must make Death Saving Throws.
- [ ] DAMAGE AT 0 HIT POINTS: Each time a creature with 0 hit points takes damage, it sufers a death roll failure and is no longer stable. If the damage equals the creature’s hit point maximum, it dies.
- [ ] DEATH ROLLS: Roll a d20. If roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. On a natural 1, saving throw counts as 2 failures. On a natural 20, regain 1 hit point.

- [ ] Exhaustion 3: Disadvantage on attack rolls & STs
- [ ] Exhaustion 4: HP max halved
- [ ] Exhaustion 5: Speed reduced to 0
- [ ] Exhaustion 6: Death


## Healing

- [ ] [[5e Short Rest 1h]] (1+ Hours): With a short rest (1+ hour), spend 1 or more HD, roll die, add Con modifer. After the roll, you can optionally spend more HD, up to your max HD. Regain HP equal to total. Once HD spent, long rest required to regain them.
- [ ] [[5e Long Rest 8h]] (8 Hours) : Around 8 hours, no more than 2 hours on watch. Need at least 1 HP to take long rest. Only once per 24 hours. At end of rest, regain all hit points and half of your maximum number of Hit Dice. Not in rules but clarifed by the designers: Elves cannot use their Trance to get the beneft of long rest in 4 hours instead of 8; they still need 8 hours rest (they simply spend only 4 of it zonked out.). At 1st level, if you take a long rest, you regain 1 HD back (despite rounding down of .5 = 0).
- [ ] FIRST AID: DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to use frst aid to stabilize without healers kit.
- [ ] MEDICINE SKILL: A dying creature or player can be stabilized with a DC 10 medicine check. [P76]
- [ ] STABILIZED: If stabilized, creature is unconscious but no longer makes death saving throws. If not healed, will remain unconscious until regain 1 HP after 1d4 hours have passed (at which point you regain 1 HP).
- [ ] STABILIZING A CREATURE: You can use your action to administer frst aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
- [ ] SPENDING HD WHILE STABILIZED: Not in the rules but clarifed by the designers: a stabilized PC (i.e. at 0 hp) can spend HD (if he has any remaining) after a 1 hour short rest even though the PC will regain 1HP after 1d4 hours.
- [ ] HEALERS KIT: Has 10 uses. You can expend one use of the kit, as an action, to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points without doing a Wisdom (Medicine) check.
- [ ] HEALING: While HP < 0, healing frst brings HP to 0, then adds HP as normal (e.g. you’re at -5 HP, cure light wounds grants 8 HP, you now have 8 HP).


## Spellcasting

- [ ] Spell Save DC: 8 + magic ability mod + profciency bonus
- [ ] SPELL ATTACK MODIFIER: Profciency Bonus + Ability Modifer.
- [ ] SPELLCASTING IN ARMOR: Requires profciency in that armor. Wearing armor without profciency prevents spellcasting.
- [ ] STACKING: Spell efects stack except same spell cast multiple times (which takes highest bonus).
- [ ] RITUALS: Advantage is id doesn't consume a spell slot, but it takes longer and consumes magical components.
- [ ] COPYING A SPELL INTO A SPELLBOOK: When you fnd a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, a wizard can add it to their spellbook if it is of a level for which they have spell slots and if they can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
