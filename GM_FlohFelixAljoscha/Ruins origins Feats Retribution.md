When you are in danger, you can speak a word of power as a reaction and select an enemy creature within 30 feet that can hear you. For the next minute, whenever you take dam- age from the chosen enemy, it is divided in half and assigned both to you and that enemy (you take the additional point if the damage amount is odd). After the effect ends, you must take an extended rest before using this feature again.
