	-  [[202001052051 Whitehack Auction]] for 5e Chases
		- I'm not really a fan of fiddly chase rules for a quick retreat. That should just be accomplished by role-playing and making some sort of on the fly adjudication.
		- If there's a prolonged chase across a lot of terrain though you could use the Whitehack auction system:
			- Both sides roll 1d6 secretly and add it to a relevant attribute. They then make bids, promising to roll over what they bid, but equal or under the (secret) 1d6 + stat number.
			- Highest bidder rolls first and then reveals what their secret number was. If they fail, the next highest bidder rolls and so on.
			- I don't use roll under stats, but I've picked a few numbers for different movement speeds that I use. For example if a monster is slow than they add their 1d6 to 6, medium is 9 and fast is 13. Unencumbered PCs use 9, encumbered ones use 6.
			-  Otherwise I would assume you just use STR or DEX.
		- [[602012210080 Session Log 49 202210092100]] consisted of mostly Auctions. Auctions do not work well for chase scenes because there is only one winner. The relative positioning of the pursuers is not addressed. I do like auctions but they work best for one-and-done situations.
	- Skil Challenge:
		- I just use a simple [[skill challenges]] type mechanic to handle any event that is played out as a montage of scenes such as a chase. 3 successes to win. 3 failures to lose. Each round I present the chase scenario, a player must present a solution. I counter with possible consequences (both good and bad) and what must be tested. Player might try to negotiate or accept the check. Next round I present the next scenario, trying to weave in the last round's context - a new player must present a solution (no repeats until all active participants have gone).
		- So that's the framework. As for the actual test it'd depend on what actual system you are using. Systems with built in skill checks are easy, just use that. For something without a skill system. I just use a 2d6 vs 8. Based upon any speed/mobility advantages as well as the roleplaying solutions would provide modifiers to the check.
		- I find the most flexibilty comes from negotiating consequences. For example a player might try something bold to gain additional success effects such as dealing damage or providing a permanent bonus for the rest of the chase, but at a greater risk such as taking damage, taking an additional failure or being knocked out of the chase completely.

## Chases

Strict application of the movement rules can turn a potentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair. Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while creatures with the same speed never close the distance between each other. This set of rules can make chases more exciting by introducing random elements.
[[201911241948 Old-School Essentials - Classic Fantasy Rules Tome v1-1]] Evasion and Pursuit p 119 or https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Evasion_and_Pursuit

### Beginning a Chase

A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any participants not already in initiative order must roll initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase can take one action and move on its turn. The chase ends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes.

When a chase begins, determine the starting distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track the distance between them, and designate the pursuer closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer might change from round to round.

### Running the Chase

Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to use the [[202202101902 5e Actions in Combat Dash]] action every round. Pursuers who stop to cast spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their quarry, and a quarry that does so is likely to be caught.

#### Dashing

During the chase, a participant can freely use the [[202202101902 5e Actions in Combat Dash]] action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional [[202202101902 5e Actions in Combat Dash]] dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one level of exhaustion. **so this takes on average 4-5 rounds. But with competent characters I can take much longer**

A participant drops out of the chase if its [[202202102002 5e Conditions Exhaustion]] reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature can remove the levels of [[202202102002 5e Conditions Exhaustion]] it gained during the chase by finishing a short or long rest.

#### Spells and Attacks

A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells against other creatures within range. Apply the normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks and spells.

Chase participants can’t normally make opportunity attacks against each other, since they are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, participants can still be the targets of opportunity attacks from creatures not participating in the chase. For example, adventurers who chase a thief past a gang of thugs in an alley might provoke opportunity attacks from the thugs.

### Ending a Chase

A chase ends when one side or the other stops, when the quarry escapes, or when the pursuers are close enough to their quarry to catch it.

If neither side gives up the chase, the quarry makes a [[5e Skills Stealth]] check at the end of each round, after every participant in the chase has taken its turn. The result is compared to the passive [[5e Skills Perception]] scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple creatures, they all make the check.

If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer’s sight, the check fails automatically. Otherwise, if the result of the quarry’s check is greater than the highest passive score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues for another round.

The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its check based on prevailing circumstances, as shown in the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check, the quarry has neither, as usual.

Escape Factors
| Factor                                                                    | Check Has…   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Quarry has many things to hide behind                                     | Advantage    |
| Quarry is in a very crowded or noisy area                                 | Advantage    |
| Quarry has few things to hide behind                                      | Disadvantage |
| Quarry is in an uncrowded or quiet area                                   | Disadvantage |
| The lead pursuer is a ranger or has proficiency in [[5e Skills Survival]] | Disadvantage |

Other factors might help or hinder the quarry’s ability to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with a [[faerie fire 60 ft adv for attacks on creat d]] spell cast on it might have disadvantage on checks made to escape because it’s much easier to spot.

Escape doesn’t necessarily mean the quarry has outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban setting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to where it went.

### Chase Complications

As with any good chase scene, complications can arise to make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban Chase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase Complication table provide several examples.

**Complications occur randomly**. Each participant in the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the appropriate table to determine whether a complication occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant affected by the complication can spend inspiration to negate the complication.

Characters can create their own complications to shake off pursuers (for example, casting the [[5e spells web w]] spell in a narrow alleyway). Adjudicate these as you see fit.

| 9     | An overzealous [[guard]] mistakes you for someone else. If you move 20 feet or more on your turn, the guard makes an opportunity attack against you with a spear (+3 to hit; 1d6 + 1 piercing damage on a hit).                                                       |
| 10    | You are forced to make a sharp turn to avoid colliding with something impassable. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the turn. On a failed save, you collide with something hard and take 1d4 bludgeoning damage.                                        |

#### Designing Your Own Chase Tables

The tables presented here don’t work for all possible environments. A chase through the sewers of Baldur’s Gate or through the spiderweb-filled alleys of Menzoberranzan might inspire you to create your own table.

#### Splitting Up

Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase separately. Run a round of one chase, then a round of the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each separate group.

#### Mapping the Chase

If you have the opportunity to plan out a chase, take the time to draw a rough map that shows the route. Insert obstacles at specific points, especially ones that require the characters to make ability checks or saving throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random table of complications similar to the ones in this section. Otherwise, improvise as you play.

Complications can be barriers to progress or opportunities for mayhem. Characters being chased through a forest by [[bugbear]]s might spot a wasp nest and slow down long enough to attack the nest or throw rocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers.

A map of a chase can be linear or have many branches, depending on the nature of the chase. For example, a mine cart chase might have few (if any) branches, while a sewer chase might have several.

#### Role Reversal

During a chase, it’s possible for the pursuers to become the quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief through a marketplace might draw unwanted attention from other members of the thieves’ guild. As they pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, the fleeing thief might run into the waiting arms of his accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide to flee with the thieves in pursuit.

There are also special Chase Rule sin Ruins of Symbaroum [[Ruins-of-Symbaroum-Gamemasters-Guide.pdf]]p161


# Ruins of Symbaroum Chases
Chases can take forever. The fleeing creature need 3 more successes than the pursuers.
## 1. Decide the range of the chase 
- Chases start at Close if both groups of creatures were in combat before the chase began. A chase might begin at a different range if the groups become aware of each other by some means. See [[Encounter Distance]]
- If the range of the chase is **Close** then the pursuing creatures are nipping at the heels of the fleeing creatures and they could be caught at any moment.
- If the range of the chase is **Far** then the pursuing creatures can consistently see the fleeing creatures but need to gain ground or wait for them to hit an obstacle before they can catch them.
- If the range of the chase is **Seeking** then the fleeing creatures have all but escaped and the creatures pursuing them must use senses other than sight or follow a trail left by the fleeing group.
    
    The range of the chase will change as the chase progresses.

## 2. the chase contest  
Each turn we check to see if either group manages to outpace the other. To do this, each member of the opposing groups makes a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) (their choice) check. The group with the highest single total wins the contest.
- If the fleeing group succeeds then the chase’s range increases. If the range of the chase was at Seeking and the fleeing group succeeds they escape.
- If the pursuing group succeeds then the chase’s range shrinks. If the range of the chase was at Close then they catch the fleeing group and the chase ends. Proceed to combat, which lasts for a minimum of one round as the fleeing creatures are forced to defend themselves before they have the opportunity to flee into another chase.

If the range of the chase is Seeking then the pursuing creatures may follow the trail of the fleeing creatures and use Wisdom (Survival) for the chase contest.

If anyone rolls a natural 1, then that group faces an obstacle.

## 3. obstacles  
If a group of adventurers faces an obstacle, roll on the common obstacles table and resolve the action. This may inflict damage or cause advantage or disadvantage on the next escape contest.

## 4. Make a risky Move (optional)  
The fleeing creatures may choose to **Make a Risky Move**, if they do, roll on the special table relevant to the environment of the chase and resolve the action. This may change the range of the chase or have long term consequences for the fleeing creatures.
After resolving the action from the special table, increase the range of the race. This is the payoff for the fleeing creatures making a risky move.
The fleeing creatures may only **Make a Risky Move** if the range of the chase is Close or Seeking.

If the chase is still going after resolving these steps repeat steps 2–4.

## Obstacles
### D8 Common Obstacles
These events can occur in any environment.

1d8 Encounter
1 A group of hostile humanoids blocks your progress. Make a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check (your choice). On a successful check you convince them to let you pass. On a failed check they hinder your progress and you have disadvantage on the next chase contest. Monstrous creatures never gain disadvantage from this result, the humanoids flee from them instead.

2 Your sprint takes you past a sleeping beast such as a feral dog or a creature of Davokar. Make a DC 11 group Dexterity (Stealth) check to pass without disturbing the beast. On a failed check the creature that rolled the lowest takes 1d8 + 3 slashing damage as the beast strikes them.

3 The environment around you becomes hazardous, such as a field of broken glass or a mass of thorns. Make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the hazard. Every creature that failed the save takes 1d4 piercing damage.

4 A barrier such as a dense thicket or a fallen statue blocks your path. Make a group DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to get past the obstacle. On a failed check you make the next chase contest with disadvantage.

5 Your path takes you underground or into a cluttered area. Make a group DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check, on a successful check you find a shortcut and have advantage on your next chase contest. On a failed check you become lost and make the next chase contest with disadvantage.

6 A herd of beasts such as cows or the blight-stricken animals of Davokar blocks the way. Make a DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to pass through the beasts unimpeded. On a failed check you make the next chase contest with disadvantage.

7 Your flight takes you to higher ground, make a group DC 13 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (your choice). On a successful check you gain advantage on your next chase contest. On a failed check the creature with the lowest result falls taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage and you make the next chase contest with disadvantage.

8 A group of friendly humanoids gathers in your path. Make a DC 14 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check (your choice). On a success they help you flee and you gain advantage on the next escape check. On a failed check they do not assist you and likely flee themselves. Monstrous creatures never gain advantage from this result, the humanoids flee from them instead.


### D4 City Chase Obstacles

 1 You pass a group of nobles preparing for a hunt, their mastiffs break leash and attempt to subdue you. Make a group DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check to escape the hounds. On a failed check the creature that rolled the lowest is dragged to the ground and then savaged by the dogs. They take 2d6 piercing damage and the group makes the next chase contest at disadvantage.

 2 A group of street performers has attracted a crowd. Make a group DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) or Charisma (Deception) check to hide in the crowd. On a success you gain advantage on the next chase contest as you evade pursuit. If any of the characters give coins to the street performers then they receive advantage on the check to hide in the crowd.
 
3 Make a DC 13 group Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid a merchant’s stall. On a failed check the character who rolled the lowest crashes into the stall. Roll a 1d4 to determine the merchant’s goods:  
1. Weapons, take 2d6 slashing damage.  
2. Perfume, creatures pursuing you in a chase have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) chase contests for the next hour. 
3. Exotic animals, take 1d4 + 1d6 damage and make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, becoming poisoned for 1 turn on a failure.  
4. Luxury goods sold under the protection of hired guards. You must either bribe them with at least 10 thaler or succeed at a DC 14 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation or Persuasion) check (your choice) to talk your way out of it. On a failed check the merchant lets the characters go but uses their influence to attack the characters indirectly so long as they are in the city. The consequences of this will likely outlive the chase itself.

4 A deep rut in the ground has caused a wagon to become stuck blocking the narrow street. Make a group DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to move the wagon. On a successful check the grateful merchant gives you a ride and you have advantage on the next chase contest.

### 1d4 Farmland Chase Obstacles

1 Beautiful, alluring flowers with deadly thorns block the way. Make a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check. On a success you recall that singing to this species of flower causes them to retract their thorns; you pass unimpeded. On a failed check each character takes 1d4 slashing damage and makes the next chase contest at disadvantage.

2 Several horses graze in a paddock overlooked by a wooden tower. If you take the horses a farmer in the tower makes a ranged attack against a random character with a crossbow (+3 to hit 1d10 + 3 piercing damage). Regardless of whether he hits, there will be repercussions for the theft amongst the local populace. The horses provide advantage on chase contests for as long as you ride them. It is likely that future obstacles will make keeping the horses difficult.

3 Your flight leads into an overgrown ditch, an unhinged cultist emerges from the brambles. On her face is an obvious and ugly blightmark. She hisses and casts a spell at you. Make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, on a failed save you suffer 2d6 psychic damage and make the next chase contest with disadvantage. On a success the witch flees into the thick brambles.
