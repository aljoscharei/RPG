Aside from them often being seen on both Karvosti and in Thistle Hold, the Baiags are known for fighting alongside their tame bear beasts, called baiagorns. They live in small groups that roam the clan territory hunting and fishing, but many choose to leave the hunting grounds for varying periods â€“ something which other barbarians tend to regard as a sign of rootlessness or disloyalty.
