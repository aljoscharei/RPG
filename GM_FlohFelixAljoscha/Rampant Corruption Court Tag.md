The court is so corrupt that it’s crippling its ability to function. Even the most mundane exercises of authority require that the right people be bribed or induced, and its members have little or no interest in the overall good of the group. The leadership is hanging together only because the court is profitable and they will defend it only insofar as it remains so.

E Hopelessly venal ruler, Greedy kingmaker behind the scenes, Colorless head bureaucrat with sticky palms

F Member with an earnest loyalty to principle, Court member cast out for not playing along, Victim of some bribed crime the court committed

C The court’s members actually desperately need the money, All the graft is going to only a few strong hands, Their enemies have multiple traitors on their payrolls

T Great hoard of extracted pelf, Inescapable proof of a leader’s wrongdoing, Misdirected bribe payment

P Grimy back room where deals are made, Court salon made a market for favors, Court structure clearly starved of its supposed funds
