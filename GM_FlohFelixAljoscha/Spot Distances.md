This is a useful cheat sheet I created for understanding what characters can see in the wilderness. In practice, sight lines will vary quite a bit (due to hills, forest canopies, atmospheric haze, and other obstructions), but I’ve found it’s useful to have some reference points and a few rules of thumb.

**HORIZON**: The horizon is 3 miles away at sea level.

**NEIGHBORING HEXES**: Passing through the center of a [[Wilderness Travel Distance]] , neighboring hexes cannot be seen. If the path is biased, the nearest hexes can usually be discerned (depending on the terrain).

> _Design Note: This is one of the reasons I prefer a 12-mile hex. Unless the PCs take special action to see farther, you’ll generally be able to focus exclusively on the hex they’re currently traveling through._

**MOUNTAINS**: Mountains can be seen from 6 hexes (72 miles) away.

> _Design Note: My research indicates that most mountain ranges have an average height of 3,000 feet. If you do the math, you can see an object 3,000 feet high from about 68 miles away, which I then rounded up to 6 hexes. Or, if you reverse the math, I’m saying that at 72 miles you can see the occasional peak that’s up to 3,500 feet high in that range or thereabouts. A very tall peak of 10,000 feet could theoretically be seen from 10 hexes away on a clear day._

**ELEVATION**: Distance to the horizon in miles is the square root of (feet above sea level x 1.5 feet). Add the height of tall objects to the viewer’s. Atmospheric haze will eliminate the ability to see even the largest objects more than 3-5 hexes away.

| **Height** | **Horizon** |
| --- | --- |
| Halfling | 2 miles |
| Human | 3 miles |
| 10 ft. | 4 miles |
| 25 ft. | 6 miles |
| 50 ft. | 9 miles |
| 100 ft. | 12 miles (1 hex) |
| 400 ft. | 24 miles (2 hexes) |
| 1000 ft. | 39 miles (3 hexes) |
| 1500 ft. | 48 miles (4 hexes) |
| 2500 ft. | 60 miles (5 hexes) |

**SIGHTING**

Characters may seek out a good location for seeing long distances by taking the Sighting [watch action](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46116/roleplaying-games/5e-hexcrawl-part-3-watch-actions). Height is obviously a factor here, but finding the right sight lines can be equally important. (Climbing a tree is all well and good, but if it’s at the bottom of a valley the effect will be mitigated.) This is also why simply being “on a mountain” doesn’t automatically translate to great sighting: you’re usually surrounded by other mountains.

As a general rule of thumb, assume that characters can find a location granting them 50 feet of height (or the equivalent thereof). This will allow them to see into neighboring hexes, and possibly even see notable locations within those hexes or their current hex (which may or may not require a Wisdom (Perception) check).

If you call for a skill check to find a sighting location, consider using a [fail forward](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/38140/roleplaying-games/art-of-rulings-part-6-fictional-cleromancy) technique: On a success, the PCs get the normal benefits of sighting. On a failure, they might only be able to make out the terrain type of two or three of the nearby hexes (and no details thereof).

If circumstances suggest that the PCs would have great sight lines without needing to take special effort, that’s great. It might still be appropriate to allow them to take the Sighting action to improve their line of sight even more, extending their vision by another hex.

**ENCOUNTER DISTANCE  
**

When an encounter is generated, the distance at which the encounter may be detected will depend on the terrain in which it is occurring. (If the encounter is with a group of creatures and both sides are surprised – i.e., they do not detect each other – it’s technically possible they will pass each other without ever realizing it.)

The figures here represent typical circumstances on the ground. If the PCs are keeping watch from the top of a stone tower, for example, it’s quite possible for them to spot potential threats at much greater distances.

| **Terrain** | **Encounter Distance** |
| --- | --- |
| Desert | 6d6 x 20 feet |
| Desert, dunes | 6d6 x 10 feet |
| Forest (sparse) | 3d6 x 10 feet |
| Forest (medium) | 2d8 x 10 feet |
| Forest (dense) | 2d6 x 10 feet |
| Hills (gentle) | 2d6 x 10 feet |
| Hills (rugged) | 2d6 x 10 feet |
| Jungle | 2d6 x 10 feet |
| Moor | 2d8 x 10 feet |
| Mountains | 4d10 x 10 feet |
| Plains | 6d6 x 40 feet |
| Swamp | 6d6 x 10 feet |
| Tundra, frozen | 6d6 x 20 feet |
