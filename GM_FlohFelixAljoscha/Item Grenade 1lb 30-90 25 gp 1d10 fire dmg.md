Grenade. The alchemical grenade is the smaller cousin of the breaching pot â€“ a sturdy ceramic vessel is filled with volatile substances that explode when ignited with a fuse or when the vessel is crushed. The grenade is fist-sized and is thrown by hand or with a sling. Anyone can  use this weapon but see the sidebar about untrained use.
