Decide on a challenge rating (CR) for the source of the damage, from CR 1 (low challenge) to CR 20 (very high challenge). Then roll a number of damage dice of a particular kind, as follows:  
  
• Single-Target Damage: 7 × CR (or 2d6 per CR)  
  
• Multiple-Target Damage: 3 × CR (or 1d6 per CR)  
  
This challenge rating can be thought of as roughly equivalent to the average level of a group of characters. However, don’t automatically choose a challenge rating based on the level of the characters. Rather, the level of the challenge might be higher or lower than the characters, depending on the situation.  
  
IMPROVISED STATISTICS  
  
Whenever you need to improvise Armor Class, attack modifiers, saving throw DCs, or other combat statistics for a creature, trap, object, or obstacle, use the following guidelines based on its challenge rating::  
  
• AC = 12 + 1/2 CR  
  
• DC = 12 + 1/2 CR  
  
• Attack Bonus = 3 + 1/2 CR  
  
• Damage = 7 × CR (or 2d6 per CR)  
  
• Saving Throw with Proficiency = 3 + 1/2 CR  
  
• Hit Points = 20 × CR  
  
When improvising statistics for traps and other objects that deal damage and can be attacked to destroy them, estimate the object’s CR by comparing it to various creatures that produce the same sorts of effects in combat.
