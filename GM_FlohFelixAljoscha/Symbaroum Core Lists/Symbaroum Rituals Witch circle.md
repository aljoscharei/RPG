WiTch circle

Tradition: Witchcraft  
The mystic breathes new life into a beautiful location and turns it into a witch circle. 
- Witch circles are protected from prying eyes and influences from outside, and the mystic has more or less complete control over what happens within the circle. 
	- The mystic decides how things grow and which season it is within, and can with the Quick Growth ritual create an environment to mirror its heart’s delight.
	- It is hard to find a Witch Circle, even if you know where to look for it. It requires a [Vigilant←Discreet] test to even see the circle if encountered in the wilderness. Creatures that do not see the circle will simply walk around it, without knowing they have taken a short detour.
	- A mystic with both the Witch Circle ritual and the Alchemy ability can make an extra attempt at Alchemy tests when using the ability inside its circle. A mystic with Quick Growth, Witch Circle and Alchemy can make two extra attempts when using Alchemy.
	- A mystic who performs Borrow Beast and lets its body rest inside a Witch Circle has no limitation as to how long it can maintain the trance, since its body gets all the nutrition it needs from the ground inside the circle.
