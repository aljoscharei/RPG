| Collapsed ruin. A sinkhole has lived up to its name and pulled a building down into the Underworld. The sky can be seen high above, and mighty trees lean alarmingly far over the hole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |

| 1: Rune-carved monolith. The Loremaster feature: pre-Symbarian remains. A group who studies the runes carefully for 1d4 hours gains (1d4 × Level × 100) XP from their insights into the world prior to the rise of Symbaroum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |       |
| Monster temple. The Loremaster feature: Symbarian cult site. Those who study the temple carefully for 1d4 days gain (1d12 × Level × 100) XP and 1 permanent Corruption for their insight into Symbaroum’s dark history. They also find cult items worth 1d10 × 100 thaler. At some point during the search, one of the old “gods” slumbering underneath the temple wakes up; choose any strong monster – it does not have to belong in the Underworld.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |       |
| 2: Barbarian tower. The Loremaster feature or barbarian: the tower is a barbarian creation carved with protective witch symbols. Those who spend a day studying the tower and its protective symbols gain (1d4 × Level × 100) XP, and find arm rings and other barbarian ornaments worth 1d6 × 10 thaler. However, they also attract (PC + 1) predators (challenge rating equal to or lower than the group).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |       |
| 3: Village of Ambrian freethinkers. Obvious to everyone: a number of log houses and a palisade have collapsed and been completely demolished. Those who spend 1d4 hours searching the rubble find 1d6 Ambrian settlers of different ages, all dead and carrying 1d10 ortegs each. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check also reveals a hidden cache containing 1d10 thaler and a journal detailing the settlers’ exploits in the depths of Davokar. Studying the book grants the gaming group (1d4 × Level × 100) XP through their understanding of the hard life in the woodland gloom. The journal is also worth 1d10 thaler to scholars in Ambria. | ^ruin |

| Refuge for the blight marked. A village made up of simple huts huddled in a cave chamber. It is inhabited by 1d6 + 10 blight marked humans and goblins, led by a severely stigmatized woman named Akulina. They are afraid of everyone, and terrified of being blight born. Villagers who come alarmingly close to that fate are burned in a nearby cave. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                    |

| 1–2: Pool of bubbling blackness sometimes shooting up like a pitch black geyser (roll 1d6 per round, 1 = eruption). Whoever touches the blackness suffers 1d6 temporary Corruption, as does anyone present in the cave when the geyser erupts unless they pass a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On success the individual only suffers 1 point of temporary Corruption.  |
| 3–4: Black flakes whirling in the dark, often chaotically, sometimes almost like a coordinated dance. Anyone walking through the cave suffers 1d4 temporary Corruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5–6: Throbbing boils in the rock wall that crack open whenever something living passes by, splashing them with sticky Corruption. Those walking through the cave must pass three DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) checks or trigger one boil per failure. For each boil that cracks, the affected must pass a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 1d4 temporary corruption. |

**Rune-covered gate**: To open it requires solving a riddle, a DC 15 Intelligence check The gate leads to a Cryptlord’s court, active or abandoned. If the Cryptlord is still around, so are 1d10 Dragouls resting in their alcoves. In that case there is also an artifact in here, as well as minor treasure worth 1d10 × 10 thaler. If the place is abandoned one can only find the treasure.


**The tunnel of a World Serpent**. It is 30 feet (10 meters) in diameter and seems likely to collapse Roll 1d20 every hour; if the result is less than or equal to the number of hours spent in the tunnel then it collapses. Each creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d12 bludgeoning damage and becoming trapped in the rubble on a failure. A character that succeeds takes half damage and is not trapped. It requires 1d4 hours of work to free the creatures who become stuck.

**The scattered remains of an Ambrian expedition**: A search of the bodies provides 1d10 × 10 thaler plus a handwritten letter describing the expedition and its progress so far. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation or Nature) check can determine what type of monster wiped out the expedition – use the encounter table above or whatever else seems appropriate.




**Crystal column, ice blue with streaks of purple light (Mystics know this is a small magic node not yet destroyed by Corruption)**: This node devours all temporary Corruption generated in its vicinity, and grows increasingly dark as a result. Once it becomes utterly black (Loremaster feature or detect magic: the node can take another 100 + 1d20 Corruption), the crystal cracks and everyone in the cave chamber gains 1d10 temporary Corruption. As long as the node exists, beasts (both predators and prey) will be attracted to the area and abominations and undead are prevented from entering. Thoroughly corrupted creatures can enter, but take 1d4 radiant damage per turn.

It requires 1d4 hours of work to free the creatures who become stuck.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 19         | **The scattered remains of an Ambrian expedition**: A search of the bodies provides 1d10 × 10 thaler plus a handwritten letter describing the expedition and its progress so far. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation or Nature) check can determine what type of monster wiped out the expedition – use the encounter table above or whatever else seems appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 20         | **Crystal column, ice blue with streaks of purple light (Mystics know this is a small magic node not yet destroyed by Corruption)**: This node devours all temporary Corruption generated in its vicinity, and grows increasingly dark as a result. Once it becomes utterly black (Loremaster feature or detect magic: the node can take another 100 + 1d20 Corruption), the crystal cracks and everyone in the cave chamber gains 1d10 temporary Corruption. As long as the node exists, beasts (both predators and prey) will be attracted to the area and abominations and undead are prevented from entering. Thoroughly corrupted creatures can enter, but take 1d4 radiant damage per turn. |
