The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.

E

Cruel tyrant who broke them, Slaver trading on the hopeless, Merchant of despair and its costly escapes

F

Determined young local leader, Proud old rememberer of better days, Furious rebel against the world

C

An outside power wants to keep them safely broken, Their fall was due to their own sins and errors, They could be very dangerous if they regain their spirit

T

Symbolic item of former glory, Resources to kickstart a new source of pride, Treasure laid up in splendid times

P

Crumbling monument to a past victory, "Wealthy" town area that's shabby and ill-kept, Empty temple to a once-loved god
