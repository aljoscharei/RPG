Encounters are the individual scenes in the larger story of your adventure.

First and foremost, an encounter should be fun for the players. Second, it shouldn’t be burden for you to run. Beyond that, a well-crafted encounter usually has a straightforward objective as well as some connection to the overarching story of your campaign, building on the encounters that precede it while foreshadowing encounters yet to come.

An encounter has one of three possible outcomes: the characters succeed, the characters partly succeed, or the characters fail. The encounter needs to account for all three possibilities, and the outcome needs to have consequences so that the players feel like their successes and failures matter.

When players don’t know what they’re supposed to do in a given encounter, anticipation and excitement can quickly turn to boredom and frustration. A transparent objective alleviates the risk of players losing interest.

For example, if the overall story of your adventure involves a quest to deliver a priceless relic to a remote monastery, each encounter along the way is an opportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves the quest forward. Encounters during the trip might see the adventurers accosted by enemies determined to steal the relic, or by monsters that are constantly threatening the monastery.

Some players create their own objectives, which is to be expected and encouraged. It is, after all, as much the players’ campaign as yours. For example, a character might try to bribe enemies rather than fight them, or chase after a fleeing enemy to see where it goes. Players who ignore objectives will have to deal with the consequences, which is another important facet of encounter design.

The following objectives can be used as foundations for encounters. Although these objectives focus on a single encounter during an adventure, using the same objective in multiple encounters allows you to combine those encounters into a larger obstacle or problem the adventurers must overcome.

_**Make Peace.**_ The characters must convince two opposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict that embroils them. As a complication, the characters might have enemies on one or both of the opposing sides, or some other group or individual might be instigating the conflict to further its own ends.

_**Protect an NPC or Object.**_ The characters must act as bodyguards or protect some object in their custody. As a complication, the NPC under the party’s protection might be cursed, diseased, prone to panic attacks, too young or too old to fight, or apt to risk the lives of the adventurers through dubious decisions. The object the adventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient, cursed, or difficult to transport.

_**Retrieve an Object.**_ The adventurers must gain possession of a specific object in the area of the encounter, preferably before combat finishes. As a complication, enemies might desire the object as much as the adventurers do, forcing both parties to fight for it.

_**Run a Gauntlet.**_ The adventurers must pass through a dangerous area. This objective is similar to retrieving an object insofar as reaching the exit is a higher priority than killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a complication, as does a decision point that might lead characters astray. Other complications include traps, hazards, and monsters.

_**Sneak In.**_ The adventurers need to move through the encounter area without making their enemies aware of their presence. Complications might ensue if they are detected.

_**Stop a Ritual.**_ The plots of evil cult leaders, malevolent warlocks, and powerful fiends often involve rituals that must be foiled. Characters engaged in stopping a ritual must typically fight their way through evil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual’s powerful magic. As a complication, the ritual might be close to completion when the characters arrive, imposing a time limit. Depending on the ritual, its completion might have immediate consequences as well.

_**Take Out a Single Target.**_ The villain is surrounded by minions powerful enough to kill the adventurers. The characters can flee and hope to confront the villain another day, or they can try to fight their way through the minions to take out their target. As a complication, the minions might be innocent creatures under the villain’s control. Killing the villain means breaking that control, but the adventurers must endure the minions’ attacks until they do.

When creating a combat encounter, let your imagination run wild and build something your players will enjoy. Once you have the details figured out, use this section to adjust the difficulty of the encounter.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#CombatEncounterDifficulty)Combat Encounter Difficulty

There are four categories of encounter difficulty.

_**Easy.**_ An easy encounter doesn’t tax the characters’ resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed.

_**Medium.**_ A medium encounter usually has one or two scary moments for the players, but the characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing resources.

_**Hard.**_ A hard encounter could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more characters might die.

_**Deadly.**_ A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or more player characters. Survival often requires good tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#EvaluatingEncounterDifficulty)Evaluating Encounter Difficulty

Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any combat encounter.

1.  _**Determine XP Thresholds.**_ First, determine the experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table below has four XP thresholds for each character level, one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a character’s level to determine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this process for every character in the party.
    
2.  _**Determine the Party’s XP Threshold.**_ For each category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters’ XP thresholds. This determines the party’s XP threshold. You’ll end up with four totals, one for each category of encounter difficulty.
    
    For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character, the party’s totaled XP thresholds would be as follows:
    
    **Easy:** 275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50)
    
    **Medium:** 550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + 100)
    
    **Hard:** 825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)
    
    **Deadly:** 1,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)
    
    Record the totals, because you can use them for every encounter in your adventure.
    
3.  _**Total the Monsters’ XP.**_ Add up the XP for all of the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP value in its stat block.
    
4.  _**Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters.**_ If the encounter includes more than one monster, apply a multiplier to the monsters’ total XP. The more monsters there are, the more attack rolls you’re making against the characters in a given round, and the more dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter’s difficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multipliers table.
    
    For example, if an encounter includes four monsters worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. This adjusted value is _not_ what the monsters are worth in terms of XP; the adjusted value’s only purpose is to help you accurately assess the encounter’s difficulty.
    
    When making this calculation, don’t count any monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the group unless you think the weak monsters significantly contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.
    

[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#EncounterMultipliers)Encounter Multipliers

| Number of Monsters | Multiplier |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| 1                  | × 1        |
| 2                  | × 1.5      |
| 3–6                | × 2        |
| 7–10               | × 2.5      |
| 11–14              | × 3        |
| 15 or more         | × 4        |

6.  _**Compare XP.**_ Compare the monsters’ adjusted XP value to the party’s XP thresholds. The threshold that equals the adjusted XP value determines the encounter’s difficulty. If there’s no match, use the closest threshold that is lower than the adjusted XP value.
    
    For example, an encounter with one [bugbear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16817-bugbear) and three [hobgoblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16925-hobgoblin) has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, making it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character (which has a hard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly encounter threshold of 1,400 XP).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#PartySize)Party Size

The preceding guidelines assume that you have a party consisting of three to five adventurers.

If the party contains fewer than three characters, apply the next highest multiplier on the Encounter Multipliers table. For example, apply a multiplier of 1.5 when the characters fight a single monster, and a multiplier of 5 for groups of fifteen or more monsters.

If the party contains six or more characters, use the next lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 0.5 for a single monster.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#MultipartEncounters)Multipart Encounters

Sometimes an encounter features multiple enemies that the party doesn’t face all at once. For example, monsters might come at the party in waves. For such encounters, treat each discrete part or wave as a separate encounter for the purpose of determining its difficulty.

A party can’t benefit from a short rest between parts of a multipart encounter, so they won’t be able to spend Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that require a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is higher than one-third of the party’s expected XP total for the adventuring day (see “The Adventuring Day,” below), the encounter is going to be tougher than the sum of its parts.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#BuildingEncountersonaBudget)Building Encounters on a Budget

You can build an encounter if you know its desired difficulty. The party’s XP thresholds give you an XP budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy, medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than their base XP values would indicate (see step 4).

[![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/836/280/729/c3-07.png)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/836/c3-07.png)

For example, using the party from step 2, you can build a medium encounter by making sure that the adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party’s threshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825 XP (the party’s threshold for a hard encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such as a [manticore](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16951-manticore) or [owlbear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16975-owlbear)) is worth 700 XP, so that’s one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of [dire wolves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16841-dire-wolf) (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the party as well.

To assist with this approach, the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual") can be sorted to present a list of all monsters in the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual") organized by challenge rating.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#ModifyingEncounterDifficulty)Modifying Encounter Difficulty

An encounter can be made easier or harder based on the choice of location and the situation.

Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step (from easy to medium, for example) if the characters have a drawback that their enemies don’t. Reduce the difficulty by one step if the characters have a benefit that their enemies don’t. Any additional benefit or drawback pushes the encounter one step in the appropriate direction. If the characters have both a benefit and a drawback, the two cancel each other out.

Situational drawbacks include the following:

-   The whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn’t.
-   The enemy has cover, and the party doesn’t.
-   The characters are unable to see the enemy.
-   The characters are taking damage every round from some environmental effect or magical source, and the enemy isn’t.
-   The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst of scaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor, or otherwise in a situation that greatly hinders their mobility or makes them sitting ducks.

Situational benefits are similar to drawbacks except that they benefit the characters instead of the enemy.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#FunCombatEncounters)Fun Combat Encounters

The following features can add more fun and suspense to a combat encounter:

-   Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the characters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope bridge and pools of green slime
-   Terrain features that provide a change of elevation, such as pits, stacks of empty crates, ledges, and balconies
-   Features that either inspire or force characters and their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling blade traps
-   Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive positions, so that characters who normally attack at range are forced to move around the battlefield
-   Different types of monsters working together
