eLf traits

The following traits are for Summer Elves:  
• Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases

by 2. Increase any other ability score by 1.  
• Age. An elf that has reached the summer life phase is about a hundred years old and will be active for up to a century and a half before feeling the call of the deep

sleep again.  
• Size. Summer elves are about five-and-a-half feet tall

and average around 120 pounds. Your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first level you have 8 hit points plus your Constitution modifier. When you gain a level in any class, you gain an additional Hit Die and 5 (1d8) plus your Constitution modifier hit points.

• Speed. You have a base speed of 30 feet.  
• Darkvision. Accustomed to the gloom of Davokar, you

have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

• Pariahs. Ambrians detest elves and the barbarians fear them, so elves have disadvantage on Charisma checks with all humans. You can try to impersonate a changeling by wearing human clothing and imitating their behavior. When directly interacting with a human, make a Cha- risma (Deception) check against their passive Insight. On a failure, they recognize you as an elf and the Pariah effect applies.

• Wisdom of the Ages. Through the eons, the elves have amassed a vast collective wisdom; a deep well of knowl- edge and insights which many elves can access through meditation. The character is one of those who may use the know-how of previous generations to solve problems at hand.

When you take an extended rest, you can select a skill. You are proficient with that skill until you take another extended rest, at which time you select a skill (the same

or another).  
• Languages. Elves speak their own language, and often

know the troll languages as well. Those that have cause to be in human lands also learn one of the human tongues.


Elf Backgrounds

as a suGGestion, player characters of elven origin should be summer elves, in the second phase of the elven life-cycle. Sure, it is possible to play older elves, but autumn elves would fare better in a campaign where the other charac- ters are also very powerful since these elvish beings tend to overshadow most humans in terms of skill, power and insights regarding the deep mysteries of the world.

In any case, elves are uncommon in human settlements and need very strong reasons to travel to such places.

Avenger

Elves tend to live, hunt and fight in small groups with strong internal ties. Maybe the others died as a result of treachery by some supposed ally, and you survived, by chance or after having managed to escape or beat down the villain’s hench- men? As the lone survivor you might feel guilty and will not return home before the traitor has paid for their crime. • SkillProficiencies(chooseone):AthleticsorAcrobatics • ToolProficiencies(chooseone):Gamingsetormusical

instrument  
• Equipment:Akittomatchyourtoolproficiency,supple

leather clothes and 4d6 + 1 ortegs.

Feature: Tracker

When you are in a wilderness area and in pursuit of a creature that you have seen before, you have advantage on the first Wisdom (Survival) check of the day to follow their tracks.

Suggested Characteristics

Many avengers have taken their quest on as a personal bur- den and you must choose how your mission has affected you.


Exile

Elves who act against the rules of the collective are very uncommon, but are not unheard of in corrupted Davokar. Maybe you are one of these? Alternatively, your exile is self-imposed, as a result of you feeling as if you had been disloyal or dishonorable, therefore choosing solitude for a while. Or forever.

• Skill Proficiencies (choose one): Deception, Intimida- tion or Performance

• ToolProficiencies(chooseone):Carpenter’stools,tin- ker’s tools, weaver’s tools or woodcarver’s tools.

• Equipment:Akittomatchyourtoolproficiency,elvish clothing and 10d6 ortegs.

Feature: Unpredictable

You choose your own moments to act, even in the thick of combat. After you roll initiative, but before combat begins, you can choose to change your initiative count to any num- ber smaller than your result, to a minimum of your Dex- terity modifier. Once you pick your new initiative count, it remains fixed for the remainder of the combat.

example: Elona-Tel has a +3 as her Dexterity modifier. She rolls for initiative and her result is 15 (12 on the d20 +3). She can then choose to change her initiative to any number less than 15 and equal to or greater than 3. Listening to the other players’ results she chooses initiative count 8 so that she can react after the knight’s turn.

Suggested Characteristics

You have taken on a life outside the forest and chosen to interact with others, however this does not relieve you of your obligations unless you have totally rejected elven life.


Mediator

You have been sent to establish relations with a group of humans and try to teach them about the value of the forest and the dangers of exploration. Your mission can be self- imposed but is more likely based on the orders of some su- perior autumn elf.

• Skill Proficiencies (choose one): History, Insight, Per- formance, or Persuasion

• ToolProficiencies(chooseone):Anymusicalinstrument • Equipment:Themusicalinstrument,elvenclothes,and

4d6 + 1 shillings.

Feature: Orator

Your strength with words is such that you can make ene- mies hesitant to attack you. If the enemy can hear and un- derstand you, and you have spoken within 1 minute before combat begins, then those enemies have disadvantage on their initiative rolls.

Suggested Characteristics

You have chosen, or been chosen to be a peace offering be- tween your people and the others. You may not appreciate this or you might have high ambitions.


Scout

You have been sent to gather knowledge, to assess the ene- my’s strengths and weaknesses before the battle that is sure to come. Your mission-giver is probably a superior and older elf, either a diplomat or a warmonger.

• Skill Proficiencies: Stealth  
• Tool Proficiencies (choose One): Carpenter’s tools or

mason’s tools  
• Equipment: A kit to match your tool proficiency, thick

working clothes and 1d6 + 4 shillings.

Feature: Adept of the Wild

When you are in a wilderness area, you can choose to take advantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) check. If you do so, you can’t use this feature again until you take a short or longer rest.

Suggested Characteristics

You are a dedicated member of the Iron Pact, seeking knowl- edge today to prevent disaster tomorrow. As you gain knowl- edge of the world outside the forest will you remain resolute in your decisions?
