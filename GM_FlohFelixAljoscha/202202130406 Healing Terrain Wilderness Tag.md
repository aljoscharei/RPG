This site borders a shrinking arratu, one being slowly driven back by the Legacy, the work of human hands, or some native life form thatâ€™s capable of successfully competing with the alien life. There are usually some pioneers or scavengers trying to take advantage of the shrinking waste, either to work the newly-arable land or plunder the ruins its receding tide reveals.

E Furious and frustrated Outsider wastemaker, Monstrous beast in too small a hunting ground, Local tyrant seeking dominion over the new pioneers

F Plucky new colonist, Earnest professional mender of wastes, Luckless soldier sent to defend the new locals

C The shrinking wastes are revealing a lost human city below, As the waste shrinks its effects are getting more concentrated inside it, The receding zone is opening a safe path for old enemies to strike the new holdings

T Treasures long lost within the waste, Possessions cherished by a now-dead pioneer, Precious product of the alien flora that now grows scarce

P Half-warped glade where alien life is losing, Newly-built steading, Exposed ancient structure
