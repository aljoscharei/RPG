Once a bustling trading post for plainsfolk, pilgrims traveling west, and those heading north, Sunstrider Camp is now choked with refugees from the surrounding areas.

The permanent structures here provided a winter camp for the biggest of the horse clans of the plains, and the Horse Lady Tsaga and her riders have taken charge. They’ve fortified the winter camp further and opened their doors to the refugees, providing food and shelter for those unable to fight but demanding those that can join the frequent mounted raids on the undead. Many plainsfolk ride into battle on a unique type of local horse known for their speed, hardiness, and unruliness. Tales claim the horse’s origin is divine—offspring of the Horned One, or a Chosen blessing their steed when dying. In Aldermark, they’re called furemeen—firemanes.

While undead top the list of the many problems the camp has, there is also a contingent of mountain bandits using the chaos of war to enrich themselves. Tsaga has been unable to mount a serious offensive against them while the undead threat looms so heavily. There are mountain shrines to the southwest— the people in this area cling to their faith. For some it’s all they have left. Many plan to make pilgrimage to seek shelter and the protection of the gods there. The plains east of the camp are full of small enclaves of travelers, and there is no end of news from all over Aldermark here at camp, almost all of it bad. Rumors abound of the Cinder King crossing the Tempest Sea to the south.

A powerful Infamous was left behind when the Broken crossed east. Now it haunts the mountains, creeping down at night to capture prey. The screams of its victims echo off the mountain faces.

GM: Choose an Infamous from the Broken you did not pick for this campaign.

Falka—a self-styled bandit queen—has a camp up in the western mountains. From there, she has access to both the western and eastern roads and preys on many. If she could be reasoned with, the bandits could be an asset against the undead. Dead, her raids on refugees would end, and it would free up Tsaga’s soldiers from bandit duty.

mission rewards: +2 Morale. If Falka is killed, gain: +2 Supply. 1 Horses (3 uses). If Falka is allied with, gain: -1 Time. Pressure does not increase.

mission penalties: None.

The Horse Lord Nettar has thrown in with the Broken, dreaming of elevated status after they sweep the lands.
