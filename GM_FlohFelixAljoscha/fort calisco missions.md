![[Fort Calisco.png]]

Fort Calisco is under siege by one of the Broken’s forces. Safe refuge can be found within its walls, but getting in may not be so simple. The fort is well built, and has withstood several attacks, though the undead seem to have a new plan.

Within the fort, Commander Jonakas—a grizzled Aldermani veteran—has set up a crisp defense. Now, this Aldermark hero holds his position knowing this is a last stand—an attempt to divide the forces of the undead and to slow them from their eastern press long enough for the Eastern Kingdoms to mount a response.

There are military units from many nations and areas, some having come here hoping to recuperate, some seeking a place strong enough to withstand the undead assault. Jonakas has kept the peace between everyone, but many unit leaders have strong opinions on how the defense and resource allocation can be handled.

The fort is surprisingly well equipped. Most assets can be found here, and there’s no shortage of missions that need doing. A fair number of civilians are here as well, trapped in the fort with no escape in sight.
