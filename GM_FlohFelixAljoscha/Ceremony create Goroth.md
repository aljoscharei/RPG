Create Goroth,  ceremony

Tradition: Sorcery  
Those who are not prepared to sacrifice life and limb, and are not concerned about the darkening of their soul, can create a flesh-and-blood copy of themselves and through meditation use it as their vessel in the world. The creation process is conducted during a five-day ceremony and requires at least a dozen corpses of recently deceased cultural beings. 

Ceremonial focus: Nothing but the goroth 
Half effect: If the ceremony is stopped prematurely, the half-finished creature collapses in a pile of flesh, bone, and bodily fluids that quickly starts to decompose. New corpses must be obtained and the ritual must be repeated from the beginning.  
Full effect: The ceremony master gains complete control of the created creature; by putting herself into a trance, the master can share the creature’s experiences and control what is says and does. Whenever the master is not meditating the creature appears to be asleep; it cannot be woken by any means, but the master is always vaguely aware of what is happening to or going on around it and can at any time resume her trance and let the goroth wake up.

In terms of appearance and physical needs the creature is normally a perfect physical copy of the ceremony master, except that it completely lacks a spiritual shadow. It is possible to modify the creature if so desired – changing hair/eye color, removing unsightly scars/birth- marks, and so on. Hiding such changes from people who know the master well requires a successful [Discreet←Vigilant] test, but may   be impossible if major adjustments have been made (the Game Master decides).  
Unique side effect: Create Goroth will never give rise to more than one side effect in the place where it is performed. Instead the ceremony master is at constant risk of corruption as long as the goroth remains active. Once per hour a Resolute test is made, which if failed inflicts 1D4 temporary corruption on the master. The corruption subsides if the meditation is paused for more than an hour, but it might of course force the master to stop meditating and render the creature unconscious at an inconvenient time.
