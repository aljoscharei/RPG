| The fey beast is one of the most ferocious, unwav- ering predators in the region. In terms of physical shape and constitution, it resembles a jakaar or a large dog, but its gray or brown speckled fur is definitely feline. Like mare cats, the fey beast has a venomous gland right above its fangs, but while the mare cat’s venom is lethal, the fey beast’s will only paralyze the victim. And that is precisely what makes it such a fearsome predator: you can hardly spend a day in Thistle Hold without hearing stories of people who have been eaten, alive and conscious. | 13                                                                      | 9                            | 7                             | 5                            | 10                        | 15                      | 11                         | 10                          | 0                                | Accurate                                              | 13                     |                            | 11                          | 4                      | 0                                                                                               |                             | Bite 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Fey beasts hunt in packs, and would rather not attack unless they outnumber their prey by at least two-to-one.

They are visually similar to jakaars, but can grow as big as ponies and are as impressively flexible as mare cats.

Should it be attacked from a distance, it can re- taliate as long as the target is within the distance of two movement actions (see Grappling Tongue).                                                                            | Glossy greenish brown, like leathery bark (                                                                    | 0                                                       | Crushing Embrace                            | 3                      | Grappling Tongue                                |                                                   | Natural Weapon                  | 2                                                             | Robust                                            | 2                  | Iron Fist (Hun, War)                             | 2              |                                 |                                         |                                        |                       |                                                                                        |                                 |                                                                                                                                                           |                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |          |                              |                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |             |                                    |                       |                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                            |                                              |                                |                |                         |                |                             |                          |                   |             |                    |   | Strong                                                |                                                | wild       | common   |                                                                          | Fortune hunters who venture all the way into Dark Davokar will soon learn to fear the flesh-eating bush known as the Wriggle Twigs or the Killer Shrub.

Moving in clusters, they attach themselves to the hull of boats and eat their way through, hoping that the crew will fall into the water. While chewing on the planks, the leeches will not let go, even if they are attacked, but then they must first be detected.

| it relies on its exceptional flying skills to launch sweeping attacks without putting itself at risk. If the victim does not have a long weapon at his/her disposal, the wraith owl also gets a free attack each turn.

| Armor Breaker:  The master who has bound the hammer to himself/herself may after each attack, successful or parried, attempt to crush the enemy’s metal armor or shield. The attempt is performed like an extra attack – damage is rolled as usual; if the outcome is higher than the armor’s Armor value, the Armor value is permanently decreased by 1d4. If the outcome is 6 or higher the attack renders the enemy’s shield completely useless, forcing its user to throw it away. Armor Breaker can be used repeatedly against the same target.                                  |                                                                         |
