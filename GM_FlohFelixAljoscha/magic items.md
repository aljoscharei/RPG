description: General rules for magic items, including attunement, from the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).

# Magic Items 
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways. 

## Attunement 
Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.

Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.

An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.

A creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed. 

## Wearing and Wielding 
Items Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk.

When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a creature with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots. 

### Multiple Items of the Same Kind 
Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks. 

### Paired Items 
Items that come in pairs--such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves--impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either. 

## Activating an Item 
Activating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.

If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item. 

### Command Word 
A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can't be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. 

### Consumables 
Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. 

### Spells 
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability--perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature--your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply. 

### Charges 
Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained.


# Can familiars attune? I say no. Sentient magic items make more and more sense to me.  [[Symbaroum Treasure MOC#Implicit worldbuilding Sentient magic items]]
https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/rules-game-mechanics/75457-guide-familiars-and-magic-items
-   Here is a simple guide for using familiars with magic items that is consistent with the rules. Feel free to use some, all or none of what is here. If you are the DM its your world and you should feel free to do what is the most fun for your table. 
    
    **Can familiars use/attune to magic Items?**
    
    Yes they are creatures and can use magic items. They can also attune to them provided the meet any requirements the item has for attunement. 
    
    **How many?**
    
    Same as any other creature 3. There is no reason to arbitrarily handicap a creatures attunement slots just because it isn't a PC.
    
    Adventures league games do have an added restriction: _"...any item attuned to an NPC under your control (such as but not limited to, familiars, beast companions, simulacrums, conjured creatures, hirelings, lickspittles, etc.) counts against both the controlling character’s limit of three attuned items and the character’s permanent magic item count."_   
    
    This adventure's league rule isn't a bad guide to use in your home game if you like. And it will make your life easier as a DM. Basically the player (not the character) has attunement slots but any creature the player controls can use them up. So you and your familiar split your 3 attunement slots. It's fine and can save you some headaches down the road. But remember this is an Adventures League Specific rule for organized play. Home games don't have a limit on a character's permanent magic item count either. The reason they do this and why attunement slots exist is to limit the number of powerful items any one character controls. Having a character with access to 6 attunement items when everyone else only has 3 can shift the power balance in an unfair way. But you shouldn't be afraid to let familiars use and attune to magic items at your table. You just have to be more conscious of it
    
    How Jeremy Crawford responded to the attunement question on twitter: "Do magic items attuned to a familiar count against the arcanist's total # of attuned items?"   J.C. - _"The magic item attunement of your companions has no effect on the number of items you can attune to."_
    
    Whats a _companion_???? -  a person or animal with whom one spends a lot of time with whom one travels with. If you think in answering this question that Jeremy was only referring to a Rangers Animal Companion; he was not. Ask him yourself. He meant "companions" the word not the ranger ability. So this includes but isn't limited to _familiars, beast companions, simulacrums, conjured creatures, hirelings, lickspittles, etc. (oh a lickspittle is someone who behaves_ _obsequiously to those in power. Like a roadie or an entourage)_
    
    **Does a familiar take a magic item with it when it disappears to its pocket dimension or when it dies?**
    
    Short answer: No. Long answer: Noooooooooooo. The ability for a familiar to be able to grab an item and disappear with it indefinitely can be game breaking. This allows for too many problems. Familiars can circumvent dungeons and traps or hide campaign important items. It creates a lot of issues if you let familiars do this. 
    
    Now as a DM I would make the exception for items the familiar has attuned to it. Attunement creates a bond between the two. It makes sense that a an item bound to the familiar can disappear with it. Although It goes without saying that I wouldn't include Artifacts in this list as they are usually a special case for everything. This is my take as a DM at my table but feel free to make your own ruling. There is nothing wrong with a blanket statement of "No they can't take items with them ever."
    
    **If the familiar dies does it lose attunement to its magic items?**
    
    If it died then yes.... BUT.... Familiars don't die. This isn't clearly spelled out for you in the books, but when the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. That isn't the same as death though. If the familiar died the spell would say so. When players controlled character or creature drop to 0 hit points they start making death saves but they don't automatically die just for dropping to 0 hit points. Familiars at 0 hit points just disappear (presumably to its pocket dimension but the spell doesn't actually say where it disappears to). It reappears after you cast this spell again. A familiar is more likely to lose attunement to an item if it is more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours (like being in a pocket dimension away from the item for 24 hrs)
    
    **Too Long Didn't Read:**
    
    Yes Familiars can use magic item. As for if they can Attune to the items, the easiest thing to Houserule is to not allow them to attune to their own magic items, but there is nothing against the rules by letting them attune to their own items. If you do, then you as a DM just need to be more intentional about watching the power balance between characters. Ultimately go by what is the most fun for you and your players. Work with your players to keep it fun for everyone.

    Well, there kinda is and you state it here:
    
    > Having a character with access to 6 attunement items when everyone else only has 3 can shift the power balance in an unfair way.
    
    Of course I get that you're not presenting these as hard and fast rules, but it seems a bit arbitrary to me that doubling the attuned items under a player's control is ok but sending any of those to the familiar's pocket dimension is game-breaking.
    
    At any rate, I'm sure it's fine at many tables and ultimately a DM can control attunement by limiting the distribution of those types of items. But I'm pretty sure if I did it at my table, my players would abuse the heck out of it.


## Magic Items
https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#MagicItems 

Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s capabilities in wondrous ways.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Rarity)Rarity

Each magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items, such as a [potion of healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4708-potion-of-healing), are the most plentiful. Some legendary items, such as the [apparatus of Kwalish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5344-apparatus-of-kwalish), are unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and mishaps. Even uncommon items can’t be easily created. Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities.

Rarity provides a rough measure of an item’s power relative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity table. A character doesn’t typically find a rare magic item, for example, until around 5th level. That said, rarity shouldn’t get in the way of your campaign’s story. If you want a [ring of invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4723-ring-of-invisibility) to fall into the hands of a 1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will arise from that event.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#IdentifyingaMagicItem)Identifying a Magic Item

Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a magic item’s appearance, handling the item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about it. Discovering a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic, however.

The [identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.

Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it’s a [ring of feather falling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4721-ring-of-feather-falling).

Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a [ring of jumping](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4724-ring-of-jumping), you could say, “Your steps feel strangely springy.” Perhaps the character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then say the character jumps unexpectedly high.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#VariantMoreDifficultIdentification)Variant: More Difficult Identification

**If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the [[identify better as downtime activity w]] spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does.** 

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement)Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if that monster has spell slots and uses that class’s spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.

Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.

An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one [ring of protection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4726-ring-of-protection) at a time.

A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#CursedItems)Cursed Items

Some magic items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. A magic item’s description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including the [identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item’s user when the curse’s effects are revealed.

Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the [remove curse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/remove-curse) spell.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#MagicItemCategories)Magic Item Categories

Each magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or wondrous items.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Armor)Armor

Unless an armor’s description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to function.

Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor doesn’t specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Potions)Potions

Different kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce of liquid.

Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a potion or administering a potion to another character requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.

Magic rings offer an amazing array of powers to those lucky enough to find them. Unless a ring’s description says otherwise, a ring must be worn on a finger, or a similar digit, for the ring’s magic to function.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Rods)Rods

A scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is typically made of metal, wood, or bone. It’s about 2 or 3 feet long, 1 inch thick, and 2 to 5 pounds.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Scrolls)Scrolls

Most scrolls are spells stored in written form, while a few bear unique incantations that produce potent wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.

A scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing that magic requires the user to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.

Unless a scroll’s description says otherwise, any creature that can understand a written language can read the script on a scroll and attempt to activate it.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Staffs)Staffs

A magic staff is about 5 or 6 feet long. Staffs vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds.

Unless a staff’s description says otherwise, a staff can be used as a [quarterstaff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/quarterstaff).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Wands)Wands

A magic wand is about 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Weapons)Weapons

Whether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are coveted by many adventurers.

Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or longbow. If a magic weapon doesn’t specify its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

If a magic weapon has the [ammunition](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties) property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#WondrousItems)Wondrous Items

Wondrous items include worn items such as boots, belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and other objects also fall into this catch-all category.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#WearingandWieldingItems)Wearing and Wielding Items

Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand.

In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn’t adjust. For example, armor made by the drow might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped characters.

When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs has no way to wear magic boots.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#MultipleItemsoftheSameKind)Multiple Items of the Same Kind

Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or be able to layer two cloaks.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#PairedItems)Paired Items

Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a [boot of striding and springing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4590-boots-of-striding-and-springing) on one foot and a [boot of elvenkind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4587-boots-of-elvenkind) on the other foot gains no benefit from either item.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#ActivatinganItem)Activating an Item

Activating some magic items requires a user to do something in particular, such as holding the item and uttering a command word, reading the item if it is a scroll, or drinking it if it is a potion. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules related to their activation.

If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the [Use an Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#UseanObject) action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#CommandWord)Command Word

A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken audibly for the item to operate. A magic item that requires the user to speak a command word can’t be activated in the area of any effect that prevents sound, such as the area created by the [silence](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silence) spell.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Consumables)Consumables

Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer functions.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Spells)Spells

Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item, often by expending charges from it. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a spellcasting ability - perhaps you’re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature - your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Charges)Charges

Some magic items have charges that you expend to activate its properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an [identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) spell is cast on the item, or when a creature attunes to the item. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to that item learns how many charges it regained.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#MagicItemResilience)Magic Item Resilience

Most magic items are objects of extraordinary artisanship, assembled from the finest materials with meticulous attention to detail. Thanks to this combination of careful crafting and magical reinforcement, a magic item is at least as durable as a regular item of its kind. Most magic items, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance to all damage. Artifacts are practically indestructible, requiring extreme measures to destroy.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#SpecialFeatures)Special Features

You can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking about its backstory, in much the same way you would for a location. Who made the item? Is anything unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and how was it originally used? What minor magical quirks set it apart from other items of its kind? Considering these questions is useful for turning a generic magic item, such as a [longsword, +1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5245-longsword-1) or a suit of [chain mail, +1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5086-chain-mail-1), into a more remarkable discovery.

The tables that follow can help you come up with answers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like. Some of the table entries make more sense for certain items than for others. Some magic items are made only by certain kinds of creatures, for instance; a [cloak of elvenkind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4606-cloak-of-elvenkind) is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If you roll something that doesn’t make sense, roll again, choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail as inspiration to make up your own.

| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Aberration.** The item was created by aberrations in ancient times, possibly for the use of favored humanoid thralls. When seen from the corner of the eye, the item seems to be moving.                                                                                                |
| 2–4   | **Human.** The item was created during the heyday of a fallen human kingdom, or it is tied to a human of legend. It might hold writing in a forgotten tongue or symbols whose significance is lost to the ages.                                                                           |
| 5     | **Celestial.** The weapon is half the normal weight and inscribed with feathered wings, suns, and other symbols of good. Fiends find the item’s presence repulsive.                                                                                                                       |
| 6     | **Dragon.** This item is made from scales and talons shed by a dragon. Perhaps it incorporates precious metals and gems from the dragon’s hoard. It grows slightly warm when within 120 feet of a dragon.                                                                                 |
| 7     | **Drow.** The item is half the normal weight. It is black and inscribed with spiders and webs in honor of Lolth. It might function poorly, or disintegrate, if exposed to sunlight for 1 minute or more.                                                                                  |
| 8–9   | **Dwarf.** The item is durable and has Dwarven runes worked into its design. It might be associated with a clan that would like to see it returned to their ancestral halls.                                                                                                              |
| 10    | **Elemental Air.** The item is half the normal weight and feels hollow. If it’s made of fabric, it is diaphanous.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 11    | **Elemental Earth.** This item might be crafted from stone. Any cloth or leather elements are studded with finely polished rock.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12    | **Elemental Fire.** This item is warm to the touch, and any metal parts are crafted from black iron. Sigils of flames cover its surface. Shades of red and orange are the prominent colors.                                                                                               |
| 13    | **Elemental Water.** Lustrous fish scales replace leather or cloth on this item, and metal portions are instead crafted from seashells and worked coral as hard as any metal.                                                                                                             |
| 14–15 | **Elf.** The item is half the normal weight. It is adorned with symbols of nature: leaves, vines, stars, and the like.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16    | **Fey.** The item is exquisitely crafted from the finest materials and glows with a pale radiance in moonlight, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius. Any metal in the item is silver or mithral, rather than iron or steel.                                                             |
| 17    | **Fiend.** The item is made of black iron or horn inscribed with runes, and any cloth or leather components are crafted from the hide of fiends. It is warm to the touch and features leering faces or vile runes engraved on its surface. Celestials find the item’s presence repulsive. |
| 18    | **Giant.** The item is larger than normal and was crafted by giants for use by their smaller allies.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19    | **Gnome.** The item is crafted to appear ordinary, and it might look worn. It could also incorporate gears and mechanical components, even if these aren’t essential to the item’s function.                                                                                              |
| 20    | **Undead.** The item incorporates imagery of death, such as bones and skulls, and it might be crafted from parts of corpses. It feels cold to the touch.                                                                                                                                  |

| 2   | **Bane.** This item was created by the foes of a particular culture or kind of creature. If the culture or creatures are still around, they might recognize the item and single out the bearer as an enemy.                                                                                                |

| 5   | **Prophecy.** The item features in a prophecy: its bearer is destined to play a key role in future events. Someone else who wants to play that role might try to steal the item, or someone who wants to prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled might try to kill the item’s bearer.                    |

| 9   | **Key.** The item is used to unlock a container, chamber, vault, or other entryway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10  | **Language.** The bearer can speak and understand a language of the DM’s choice while the item is on the bearer’s person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11  | **Sentinel.** Choose a kind of creature that is an enemy of the item’s creator. This item glows faintly when such creatures are within 120 feet of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12  | **Song Craft.** Whenever this item is struck or is used to strike a foe, its bearer hears a fragment of an ancient song.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 13  | **Strange Material.** The item was created from a material that is bizarre given its purpose. Its durability is unaffected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 14  | **Temperate.** The bearer suffers no harm in temperatures as cold as −20 degrees Fahrenheit or as warm as 120 degrees Fahrenheit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15  | **Unbreakable.** The item can’t be broken. Special means must be used to destroy it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 16  | **War Leader.** The bearer can use an action to cause his or her voice to carry clearly for up to 300 feet until the end of the bearer’s next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 17  | **Waterborne.** This item floats on water and other liquids. Its bearer has advantage on Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) checks to swim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 18  | **Wicked.** When the bearer is presented with an opportunity to act in a selfish or malevolent way, the item heightens the bearer’s urge to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 19  | **Illusion.** The item is imbued with illusion magic, allowing its bearer to alter the item’s appearance in minor ways. Such alterations don’t change how the item is worn, carried, or wielded, and they have no effect on its other magical properties. For example, the wearer could make a red robe appear blue, or make a gold ring look like it’s made of ivory. The item reverts to its true appearance when no one is carrying or wearing it. |
| 20  | Roll twice, rerolling any additional 20s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| d12 | Quirk                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Blissful.** While in possession of the item, the bearer feels fortunate and optimistic about what the future holds. Butterflies and other harmless creatures might frolic in the item’s presence.                  |
| 2   | **Confident.** The item helps its bearer feel self-assured.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3   | **Covetous.** The item’s bearer becomes obsessed with material wealth.                                                                                                                                               |
| 4   | **Frail.** The item crumbles, frays, chips, or cracks slightly when wielded, worn, or activated. This quirk has no effect on its properties, but if the item has seen much use, it looks decrepit.                   |
| 5   | **Hungry.** This item’s magical properties function only if fresh blood from a humanoid has been applied to it within the past 24 hours. It needs only a drop to activate.                                           |
| 6   | **Loud.** The item makes a loud noise—such as a clang, a shout, or a resonating gong—when used.                                                                                                                      |
| 7   | **Metamorphic.** The item periodically and randomly alters its appearance in slight ways. The bearer has no control over these minor alterations, which have no effect on the item’s use.                            |
| 8   | **Muttering.** The item grumbles and mutters. A creature who listens carefully to the item might learn something useful.                                                                                             |
| 9   | **Painful.** The bearer experiences a harmless flash of pain when using the item.                                                                                                                                    |
| 10  | **Possessive.** The item demands attunement when first wielded or worn, and it doesn’t allow its bearer to attune to other items. (Other items already attuned to the bearer remain so until their attunement ends.) |
| 11  | **Repulsive.** The bearer feels a sense of distaste when in contact with the item, and continues to sense discomfort while bearing it.                                                                               |
| 12  | **Slothful.** The bearer of this item feels slothful and lethargic. While attuned to the item, the bearer requires 10 hours to finish a long rest.                                                                   |
