- furthes north, feral, governed by lindworm
- Hurl venomous spiders
- Oroke Earth mother?

The members of clan Gaoia living furthest to the north are regarded as brutal and primitive, even by other barbarians. They are said to be allied with a lindworm, called Grandfather Lint, and are hardly ever seen in the south. The only exceptions are their rugged Wrathguards and the slightly more polished envoys that clan chieftain Rábaiamon [[Symbaroum Monster Rabaiamon]] sends on a courtesy call to Karvosti every other year.
