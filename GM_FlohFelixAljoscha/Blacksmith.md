All peoples in Ambria and Davokar have their own blacksmiths, which says something about their importance. Master smiths are revered in all cultures, but especially among Ambrians and trolls.

You become proficient with [[Smith s tools]] if you are not already. This feature may be used when you have downtime [[5e Downtime]] to produce metal implements. The base time requirement is 1 day per 5 thaler of market value, rounding up, and the material cost is half the market value. You can make a DC 15 Strength (Smithâ€™s Tools) check with the following effects:

- If you succeed by 5 or more, you can both halve the ma- terial cost and the total amount of time required.
- With a regular success you can either halve the material cost or the total amount of time required but not both.
- With a regular failure there is no change.  
- With a failure by 5 or more, either the time required is doubled or the material cost is increased by half (to 75%of the market value).
