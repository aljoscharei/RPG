Breaching Pot. This is a jar filled with volatile substances that explode when ignited or crushed. If the breaching pot has been buried close to a structure it has the siege quality; if it detonates in open air, it has an area effect instead. Note that whoever sets up a breaching pot must use a fuse to avoid suffering from the effect. Anyone can use a breach- ing pot but only those proficient with Alchemical Weapons can do so without risking a catastrophic failure. See the sidebar. Breaching pots can also be used as ammunition for catapults, in which case they have an area effect on impact.
