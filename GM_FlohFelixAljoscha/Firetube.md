Also at 1st level, a Sapper can choose to relinquish their sword and gain a portable alchemical firetube instead. You become proficient with alchemical weapons. Untrained use is dangerous and Sappers don’t loan out such weapons easily.

You become proficient with alchemist’s supplies if you were not already. You can make firetube powders using the DCs given and can make up to three powders per day of [[5e Downtime]]. Each powder requires raw supplies equal to half its market cost or one downtime day of gathering materials from the wild.
