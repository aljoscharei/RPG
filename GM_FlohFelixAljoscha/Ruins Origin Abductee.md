aBDuctee traits

Though abductees were taken from different cultures and social strata, each of them was also changed by their time among the elves.  
• Ability Score Increase. Increase your Dexterity and

Wisdom scores by 1 each, then add 2 to any other ability

score of your choice.  
• Age. Like other humans, abductees reach adulthood in

their late teens and live less than a century without mag-

ical assistance.  
• Size. Abductees vary almost as widely in height and

build as regular humans but tend towards the shorter side. Your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first level you have 8 hit points plus your Constitution modifier. When you gain a level in any class, you gain an additional Hit Die and 5 (1d8) plus your Constitution modifier hit points.

• Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  
• Languages. Abductees speak Elvish but cannot read

elven writing if they do not have the Loremaster fea- ture (page 105).

Abductee Backgrounds

aBDucteD huMans tenD to leave the Iron Pact for the same reasons elves sometimes do – as mediators, scouts, exiled or avengers (see page 60) – but may also have a much more personal reason for becoming an adventurer:

Runaway

For some reason – curiosity, home-sickness, abuse – the ab- ductee chooses to flee to the realm of humans, to become a special sort of stranger.  
• Skill Proficiencies: Nature

• ToolProficiencies(chooseone):Cobbler’stools,cook’s utensils, leatherworker’s tools, weaver’s tools

• Equipment:Akittomatchyourtoolproficiency,leather clothes and 1d6 ortegs.

Feature: Bushcraft

You can survive on meager resources and are used to finding food and shelter in harsh terrain. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check, the character can find enough food and water to feed themselves while being on the move in the wilderness or among Davokar’s ruins. If the character is part of a small group (up to five individuals), food and water can be found for them as well (increase the DC for the check by one for each additional person other than yourself ), but that will take much longer. The group cannot be on the move during that time.

Suggested Characteristics

You have chosen to leave the relative safety of elven society within Davokar and return to the human lands. Unfortu- nately, your welcome home is cold and cruel.
