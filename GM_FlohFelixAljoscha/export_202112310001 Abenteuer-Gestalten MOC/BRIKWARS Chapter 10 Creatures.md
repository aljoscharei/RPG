When Bawss Grimjaw tears through the scribble portal on the mighty WarWrekks, the Immortal legions defending the ruins of Conselia City know they're in for a Brootal day.

Not all creations are designed for active roles. Objects like trees, warehouses, and bridges perform their duties perfectly well by just sitting there and not wandering off at critical moments. If a creation is intended for more proactive tasks, such as moving around, carrying loads, or vaporizing civilians, it needs either a mind of its own or an intelligent operator at the controls.

The difference between a **creature** and a vehicle is that creatures are capable of independent thought and action, whether their brain is composed of meat, circuitry, or magic. A mech piloted by a minifig is a robotic vehicle; a mech operating independently to destroy all minifigs is a robotic creature.

Of all the inadvisable weapons and devices ever bolted onto a creation by negligent Humans, the **Mind** is the most destructive. A Mind harnesses the power of an Action Die to turn a structure or vehicle into an independent creature, granting it one Action per turn without any corresponding sense of moderation or decency to use that Action wisely.

Like weapons, propulsion systems, and controls, a creature's Mind must be represented by a specific physical component on the creature. For minifigs and other organic creatures, the Mind is usually contained in the head, but a Mind can be located in any appropriate container: a computer A.I. core, a haunted phylactery, an extradimensional energy crystal, or a haphazardly-wired brain in a jar, for example. If the component containing the Mind is destroyed, the Mind is also destroyed, and the creature becomes an inanimate object again unless it has at least one backup Mind still functioning.

Active BrikWars units have an Action ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d6-icon-20.png "Action d6") by default. For independent creatures, the ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d6-icon-20.png "Action d6") is all in their own Mind, while vehicles, weapon emplacements, and dependent creatures rely on the ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d6-icon-20.png "Action d6") in the Mind of a minifig handler or operator.

[Abilities](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#abilities)

Creatures with Minds have the same general abilities as a regular minifig. As long as they have the proper appendages, they can use equipment, open doors, and toss items around as normal. Common sense and a liberal application of What I Say Goes Rolls should be an adequate guide for whether a creature has the proper body shape to work a stick shift or the fine manipulators to type on a keyboard.

[Carrying and Manipulating Objects](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#carryingobjects)

By default, creatures have one pair of arms and **hands** (or close equivalents) that they can use to carry and manipulate objects (see [Carrying Items](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/7.htm#carryingitems) in [7.3: Field Construction](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/7.htm#3)).

All Natural Attacks have Use:![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/icons/ico_20_wsize.png "Weapon Size")+1 and Range:CC.

Creatures without hands or equivalent appendages may be able to clumsily carry and drag objects, but they can't operate weapons or devices in any useful way. To compensate for this, handless creatures develop improved natural combat abilities, gaining **natural attack** weapons with a total Weapon Size up to their own body Size ([8.1: Weapon Size](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/8.htm#1)). Dogs can bite, horses can kick, giant scorpions can sting, and possessed food processors can initiate a hostile puree maneuver.

-   A creature with **hands** has no special natural attacks. It can use its hands to make Grabs or Shoves, and it can use hand-held weapons and equipment items appropriate to its Size.
    
    **Examples:** Minifig hands, monkey paws, robot manipulators
    
-   A creature with teeth and claws can carry and drag objects as long as it doesn't mind getting them scratched up and slobbery. When making **Bite / Claw** attacks, its Action Die is raised to a ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d8-icon-20.png "Action d8") for Close Combat rolls, and it can make an automatic Grab with any successful hit.
    
    **Examples:** Dog teeth, lobster claws, octopus tentacles, tardigrade pharynxes
    
-   A creature with horns or antlers can push things around, and will sometimes find an object it can hook and lift. When making a **Ram** attack, its horns are a Charging weapon, and it can add a Shove to any successful hit.
    
    **Examples:** Mammoth tusks, triceratops horns, moose antlers, unicorn horns
    
-   A creature with hooves or club appendages can use them to smash things but not much else. **Kick / Club** attacks can add a Shove to any successful hit.
    
    **Examples:** Horse hooves, ankylosaurus tails, giraffe horns, modeling clay blob pseudopods
    
-   Creatures with stingers use them to **Sting**, not to waste time manipulating objects. Sting attacks do ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d4-icon-20-red.png "Damage d4")s of Poison damage ([F.1: Hazard Dice](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/f.htm#1)).
    
    **Examples:** Scorpion tails, stingray spines, giant bee butts, platypus spurs
    

[Multitasking](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#multitasking)

Like a minifig, a creature with a standard Mind has one Action and can focus on one target per turn. If that's not enough for the species a player is imagining, they can add additional ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d6-icon-20.png "Action d6") Minds as Size Enhancements.

These extra Minds must have a physical location. They may all exist in the same physical element as the creature's original Mind, or they may be put in different places if the creature doesn't want to put all its eggs in one basket.

Each Mind can receive Enhancements (+1 Action Die size) or Impairments (Half-Minded) separately - a multi-brained creature might be an expert (![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d8-icon-20.png "Action d8")) for its first Action every turn, but incompetent (![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d4-icon-20.png "Action d4")) any time it goes for a second one.

A creature with an extra Mind has an extra Action (and an extra Action Die) that it can use to focus on one additional target during its turn. With extra Actions, a creature with multiple Ranged or Close Combat attacks can divide them between multiple targets in the same turn, or use them to make multiple types of attacks on the same target. A multi-brained or superintelligent creature can even take two or more completely dissimilar Actions in the same turn (e.g., playing the piano while laying down sniper fire); however, it may not use the same weapon, hand, or equipment item for more than one Action during the turn, and it cannot use more weapons or devices than are allowed under its Power limitations ([8.1: Weapon Size](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/9.htm#4)).

Once a normal minifig student with an Action ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d6-icon-20.png "Action d6"), the future Professor improved his Mind to a powerful Action ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d10-icon-20.png "Action d10") by using programmed monkey impersonators to attend classes in his place.

With all the extra brainpower saved by avoiding formal education, Professor Monkeyhead was able to develop innovative techniques in the field of replacing his own head with a monkey. In the process, he gave himself four extra arms and a second monkey Mind with an Action ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d6-icon-20.png "Action d6"), allowing him to focus on two Actions simultaneously at different levels of skill.

<table><tbody><tr><td>1"</td><td>d10</td><td>d6</td><td>5"</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table>

He's still Size 1", so even with the extra hands he's still subject to a minifig's Power limit of two weapon inches, but he plans to use the extra Action for filling out grant applications and claiming authorship on his grad students' research.

[Half Minds](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#halfminds)

Creatures with Minds are fully independent, able to form their own strategies and wage effective warfare without supervision. If this doesn’t fit a player's vision for their creature, they may elect instead to give it a **Half Mind**.

| Half Minds |
| --- |
| Impairment | Usefulness | Notes | Examples |
| Incompetent | open to **Stupidity** | Action ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d4-icon-20.png "Action d4") | zombies, civilians |

Half-Minded creatures operate no differently than full-Minded creatures as long as their requirements for **usefulness** are met. A Horse is useful when a rider directs it, a computer is useful while it has a program to execute, an office employee is useful while under the lash, and a regular civilian can be useful when he's not being an idiot.

When the requirements for usefulness aren't met, a Half-Minded creature becomes a liability. The player controlling the creature must choose an enemy player and hand control of the creature to them. The enemy player, on their next turn, may then direct the creature to take either its movement or its Action (but not both). At the end of the turn, if the creature has not been returned to usefulness, that player must hand control of the creature to an enemy of their own. Control passes from enemy to enemy until the creature has been made useful again or until it is killed or otherwise removed from battle.

-   An **Incompetent** creature is similar to other full-Minded creatures, but due to a lack of training, motor skills, or intelligence, it is prevented from being an effective combatant. An Incompetent creature's Action die is set at a ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d4-icon-20.png "Action d4"), which means it can never roll high enough to go Over the Top. Instead, an Action ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d4-icon-20.png "Action d4") can earn Bonus ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d4-icon-20.png "Action d4")s on a Critical Success like non-Action dice.
    
    Incompetent units are blessed with an increased capacity for **Stupidity**. If a player controls more than one Incompetent unit, then at the beginning of their turn, before taking any other action, they must select an enemy player to direct how their Stupidity plays out.
    
    The enemy may select any of the player’s Incompetent units to control as if it were their own, as long as the same unit isn’t selected on two turns in a row. The controlled unit can either take one Action or take one turn's worth of movement, and then becomes confused and does nothing else for the remainder of its turn. A unit isn’t able to use any of its Specialty abilities while being controlled.
    
    It's nice if the enemy has a good story for why the unit chose that particular Stupid behavior, but not required; Incompetence doesn't have to make sense.
    
    **Examples:** Zombies, civilians, zombified civilians, corporate middle managers, clone-brand minifigs, ogres, mutants, politicians

    image rights: Silent-Sigfig, signed
    
    A **Programmed** creature is limited in its ability to make high-level strategic decisions, and instead follows a simple set of behaviors.
    
    Programmed creatures are given a list of behaviors at the beginning of the battle, and may only behave in accordance with those instructions. A Programmed behavior must be specific: "Move to the nearest wounded allies and attempt to heal them" or "Stay within 5" of the nearest allied troops and fire at enemy combatants" are fine Programmed behaviors; "Defeat all enemies" and "Win the battle" are not. Random animals and wildlife are sometimes treated as Programmed for efficiency's sake, with short behaviors like "flee from any nearby threat" or "if it's nearby and looks edible, try to eat it."
    
    While not technically creatures, mechanized defense systems are often given Programmed behaviors as well, such as "fire at anything in range and moving" or "if intelligent life is detected, release deadly neurotoxin gas."
    
    Mechanized traps are often set up with free Triggers rather than expensive Minds - see [F.2: Traps](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/f.htm#2).
    
    A Programmed creature is useful as long as it has a program to execute. Deleting the program or tricking it into a paradox can cause the creature to go haywire.
    
    **Examples:** Kill-bots, golems, summoned elementals, guard dogs, mind-control victims, bureaucrats, sheeple
    
-   A **Submissive** creature may have the ability to think on its own, but it prefers to obey the commands of a master. Under an intelligent minifig's direction, the creature may act as intelligently as if it had a full Mind, but if abandoned, the creature reverts to whatever animal-like behavior seems appropriate: milling around aimlessly, running and hiding, or attacking everything in sight.
    
    A Submissive creature loses its usefulness if its master dies, wanders off, or stops paying attention. If another intelligent minifig can catch a masterless Submissive creature, regardless of whether he's on the same team, the creature accepts him as its new master.
    
    **Examples:** Steeds, androids, grad students, interns, emotional support monsters, targeting computers, football players, talk radio listeners, fetishists, cultists
    
-   **Subjugated** creatures are oppressed with physical restraints or a threat of violence and forced to cooperate against their will, with Half a Mind to break free and run amuck. As long as they are kept Subjugated, they must follow the orders of their captors, but if they become free, they will go to any length to prevent being Subjugated again. This usually means attacking their captors or fleeing the battlefield, but can also be as simple as just attacking everything in sight, regardless of allegiance.
    
    A Subjugated creature must be kept in restraints or within attack range of an armed overseer in order to be useful. If this condition isn't met, the creature breaks free. Control of the creature is handed from enemy to enemy as usual, but can never be handed back to their original oppressors, even if they're captured and put back in chains. If the original oppressor is the only enemy at the table, control does not transfer.
    
    Once freed, a group of formerly Subjugated units receives one Instant Benny at the beginning of every turn, which they can use for directly attacking the forces of their former oppressor.
    
    **Examples:** vampiric thralls, schoolchildren, chain gangs, draft oxen, conscripts, retail employees

Records of minifigoids existing prior to Hospital 555's founding in the 1,976th Rekonstruktion are hard to verify. Myths and legends tell of wildly varying mutant dysfig races, from stunted and limbless homunculi to strange noodle-limbed giants.

The notorious Hospital 555 was staffed by faceless and limbless protofigs who captured unsuspecting minifigoids and performed horrifying genetik experiments on them. Their ABS gene-splicing madness resulted in a new order of fig entirely, equipped with arms, hands, legs, and even a face.

Consumed with rage and bloodlust after surviving experimentation twice as gruesome as technically possible, the new life form broke free from its restraints, killed the protofigs who created it, and escaped into the world. This deadly killer, genetically engineered for destruction, was the first true minifig: the Deadly Spaceman.

This is also how babies are made.

Creatures are as susceptible to damage as any other creation. Size Damage, Component Damage, and all the other special Damage types work exactly the same way ([7.2: Taking Damage](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/7.htm#2)).

When doing damage to a living creature, it's important to remember that its head and body are treated as the central structure, while any limbs, wings, tails, or tentacles are surface elements. If the creature has an Armor of 2![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d10-icon-20-blue.png "Armor d10") or better, these surface elements have a Weight class one level lower than the main body ([7.1: Structure](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/7.htm#1)).

Creatures have an extra vulnerability in that their Minds have a physical location, and they can be specifically targeted like any other device. For most creatures, destroying or severing the head is usually enough to end its adventures in a single stroke. If the location of a Mind isn't obvious from a creature's anatomy, its owner should point it out to the other players on request.

Another disadvantage of biologikal creatures (like minifigs) is that when they get wounded, they can't be conveniently patched up or reassembled by any passing Mechanik. A Mechanik's abilities only work for mechanical devices, not living flesh.

There are settings in which this rule becomes fuzzy - biomechanikal alien species, Lovecraftian abominatrices, and mad-geneticist vivisectors may occasionally pop up with attendant Mechaniks for whom biological parts are interchangeable with mechanical ones.

Fortunately, there are minifigs who specialize in meat-based repairs just like Mechaniks specialize in reconfiguring machinery. The **Medik** is a unit specially trained to perform impromptu surgeries in the field, cruelly reviving fallen soldiers over and over again so that each one can experience repeated deaths in the greatest agonizing variety.

[Ker-Triage!](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#kertriage)

**Ker-Triage! Specialty:**

allows a Medik to perform field amputations

to revive fallen minifigs and creatures

Lacking fancy operating facilities or any time for second opinions, the Medik uses the tried-and-true methods of **Ker-Triage!**, allowing him to quickly discern how many limbs need to be **amputated** in order to bring fallen minifigs and creatures back up to combat readiness.

| Ker-Triage! |
| --- |
| Roll | Amputations |
| 6+ | No amputations;  
instant revival |
| 5 | No amputations |
| 4 | 1 amputation |
| 3 | 2 amputations |
| 2 | 3 amputations |
| Crit Fail | Head amputated |

A Medik carrying proper medikal Tools ([3.4: Desperate Measures](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/3.htm#4)) can attempt to revive a fallen minifig or other creature of Size 1" or greater as long as it has at least one head still attached. To do so, he declares a Construction Action, similar to a Mechanik's ([7.3: Field Construction](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/7.htm#3)), and begins operating.

At the beginning of his next turn, if the Construction Action wasn't interrupted, the Medik rolls his Specialty ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d8-icon-20.png "Specialty d8") on the Ker-Triage! Table. (If multiple Mediks are operating on the same patient, they each roll separately, and only the highest roll is used.)

A Medik without his Tools can attempt impromptu Ker-Triage! with any bladed weapon instead, but he rolls a ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d6-icon-20.png "Specialty d6") rather than a ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d8-icon-20.png "Specialty d8").

If the Medik rolls a five or greater, congratulations! The minifig or creature is revived with no ill effects. It may immediately stand up and re-equip itself as needed (so that players don't forget it's alive), and it can continue fighting as normal starting on its following turn. (On a six or better, the revived creature can jump up and take its turn immediately.) Creatures larger than Size 1" are revived with an Effective Size of 1", along with the limitations that entails - a maximum of Armor of 1![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d10-icon-20-blue.png "Armor d10"), in particular ([7.2: Taking Damage](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/7.htm#2)).

If the Medik rolls less than five, then the problem is more serious and he'll have to perform one or more **amputations** in order to save the patient. The amputations succeed automatically; the Medik doesn't need to make any Action or Damage Rolls or spend any more Actions to remove the number of limbs indicated by the Ker-Triage! result.

Each useful limb removed (or otherwise disabled, for creatures whose limbs can't be removed) counts as one amputation. Arms and legs are the most common limbs chosen; wings and tentacles will also do. Tails don't count.

If there are not enough regular limbs to satisfy the amputation requirements, the Medik has no choice but to amputate the head. This may still save a creature if it has extra heads in reserve, but a normal one-headed creature will now be dead beyond any hope of Medikal revival.

If the Medik's Construction Action is interrupted, he still rolls on the Ker-Triage! Table and performs the indicated amputations, but the minifig or creature is not revived. The Medik can continue attempting Ker-Triage! on subsequent turns.

This tavern lout picked the wrong girl to drunkenly accost, as he discovered when Major Natalya offhandedly disarmed him.

no sign of Quadruple.Digits

The complete loss of an arm or leg is a massive trauma that causes all surrounding tissue to swell and adrenaline to course through the body, cutting off blood loss and allowing the creature to ignore the pain, at least until the end of the battle.

No matter how many limbs a creature loses, it's still capable of doing damage. Even a creature with no limbs at all can offer its services as an unusually talkative truncheon.

Spiders have a natural advantage when it comes to disposable limbs. Players might rule that it takes two spider legs to count as a single limb for Medikal amputation purposes.

image rights (informal): Bookwyrm 5/28/20

For regular propulsion types, if half or more of the creature's propulsion limbs are lost, it moves at Half Speed after applying all other penalties. For flight Propulsion, the loss of half of the Propulsion limbs means the creature is grounded and cannot fly.

If all of the propulsion limbs are lost, the creature is limited to dragging itself along by the length of any arms it still has attached. (For minifigs, whose arms are each 1/2" long, this means that a minifig with both arms and no legs can drag itself one inch per turn.) This uses up the creature's Action for the turn, and it may not use its arms for anything else.

Even if it's still able to drag itself around, a creature with no propulsion limbs is treated as one that has no Move ability - it may not Sprint, Bail, or use Angry Inches, and all Close Combat attacks against it are Automatic Hits.

A creature who loses one or more hands or arms is limited in other obvious ways. A creature with only one hand can't use a Two-Handed or Long-Ranged Weapon. A creature with no hands can't use any hand-based tools or weapons at all. Less common objects have to be considered on a case-by-case basis; it may take a What I Say Goes Roll to decide whether a given armless minifig can successfully operate a door latch with his teeth or mash the launch button for an intercontinental ballistic missile with his face.

[Bandages](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#bandages)

Where a Mechanik can use Patch repairs to repair constructions and machinery ([7.3: Field Construction](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/9.htm#1)), a Medik is able to **Bandage** wounds for larger creatures who've lost inches of Size Damage.

In order to bandage an inch of Size Damage on a creature, the Medik takes a Construction Action and performs Ker-Triage! as usual, but adds a bonus +1 to his Ker-Triage! Roll for each inch remaining in the creature's Effective Size.

On a Critical Failure, the bandage fails, and the creature takes an additional inch of Size Damage rather than being decapitated. Otherwise, as long as the creature's final head isn't amputated, the bandage is successful. The Medik's player attaches a random piece to the creature as a bandage (white or red pieces are traditional), and the creature's Effective Size goes up by one inch, to a maximum equal to the creature's current actual Size. The creature can immediately jump back into the fight if the Ker-Triage! roll is a six or greater; otherwise it spends the turn recovering.

Bandages are fragile, and restored inches of Size Damage only last as long as the Bandage does. A Bandage piece that takes even a single point of damage is destroyed, and its benefits are canceled. The creature suffers the Bandaged inch of Size Damage all over again.

The playthemes of the construction toy world offer any number of pre-molded beasts and monsters, and there's no limit to the custom species players might come up with on their own. Most of these creatures can be handled as variations of standard units - a dragon, for instance, is a Flying Horse with a FlameThrower on its face, while a telekinetic alien is just a regular minifig with a couple of SuperNatural Dice ([Chapter D: The Dice](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/d.htm)).

![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/7/creatures.jpg "Creature Sizes")

The variety of possible Creatures is limitless, but gauging their relative strength is as simple as measuring the lengths of their spinal column and cranium. Tails and jaws are excluded.

The baseline default creatures for Size 1" and 2" are the minifig and the Horse, each described in their own chapters. The standard Size 0" creature is a **Vermin**, and the standard creature of Size 3" or larger is a **Great Beast**.

**Vermin** are creatures that are so small that their Size is rounded straight down to zero. The most common Vermin are the simple one-piece pre-molded animals scattered as props in adventure settings: snakes, bats, spiders, parrots, and babies, for instance, depending on the genre. The small Size of Vermin makes them ineffective as individual units, so they are best deployed in swarms, giving them strength in numbers to harass unarmored foes and support the attacks of larger allies.

All Vermin are Half-Minded: Incompetent. On any team with multiple Vermin, it's almost guaranteed one of them will do something Stupid on every turn ([10.1: Minds](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#1)).

[Size Zero](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#sizezero)

Vermin are so small that they have no Size or mass at all. They can be carried like equipment items, or swung or thrown as Random Objects for Bite Damage. When throwing or Launching bundles of Vermin, the size of the overall bundle is used, not the sum of all the Vermin's individual zero-inch Sizes.

Zero weight gives crawling Vermin the **Spidering** ability: they can climb on any vertical or inverted surface at no penalty (although they must end their turn in a stable position for practicality's sake), and they are immune to Falling Damage ([9.5: Collisions](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/9.htm#5)).

A Vermin with proper appendages can carry a one-handed minifig equipment item or weapon at no penalty, or two such items (or one two-handed item) at Half Speed. It can't throw, operate, or use them in combat, or operate mounted weapons or other devices. Vermin have zero Momentum and offer zero Physical Opposition, and cannot attempt Shoves, even on other Vermin.

Vermin have a Weight class of zero and zero Armor. Any attack that hits a Vermin skips the Damage Roll and kills it automatically, making groups of Vermin especially vulnerable to area effects like Explosions and Arc Fire. If Vermin are Disrupted, units and objects of Size 1" or greater can crush any number of them underfoot with Trample damage ([9.5: Collisions](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/9.htm#5)). If a Vermin isn't Disrupted, a unit can choose one of them to try to stomp on, but must treat this as an Attack with Use:0. The Vermin can attempt to Bail out of the way if it wishes, or hope that the stomper Critically Fails the Attack Roll.

Due to their small Size, all attacks against Vermin have a -2 Action Penalty for target size ([5.1: Making Attacks](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/5.htm#1)).

[Tiny Attacks](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#tinyattacks)

![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/10/bees2.jpg "You all get bees!")

Deep within the Wyrdwood, Summer Fey use honeycomb lanterns to direct massive colonies of bees in the production of honey mead and the stinging to death of enemies, not necessarily in that order.

Informal rights: Bookwyrm, 5/28/20

Vermin don't have the natural attacks of larger animals. They must rely on a Tiny Bite, Tiny Spit, or Tiny Sting.

A Vermin's attack is painful but not particularly dangerous. It's only effective against unarmored creatures of Weight ½ or less, and even then it only does 1 point of Damage (or 1![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d4-icon-20-red.png "Poison d4")\-2 Poison damage for Venomous Vermin). A creature with a higher Weight class or wearing armor can ignore Vermin completely, even if the Vermin are crawling around all over it.

![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/10/venomous_vermin.jpg "Vermin")

If a Venomous Vermin's Tiny Sting does zero points of damage or less, it fails to break the skin and the Poison effect is canceled.

![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/icons/yes.png)

Vermin attacking a minifig in cooperation with non-Vermin are subject to the usual limit of three Close Combat attackers in the same turn, or else they risk being struck by their own allies' attacks. Vermin attacking by themselves can ignore this limit, forming a swarm that can pile as many attacks onto an unarmored creature as there are Vermin able to reach it.

The Vermin's single point of damage isn't enough to threaten most enemies, although their combined damage can bring down a full-sized minifig if enough of them make successful Bites at the same time. Vermin are more useful for outnumbering opponents in Close Combat to inflict Action Penalties, and for absorbing attacks to protect higher-value allies.

Whether pre-molded or player-built, brick animals' stats and abilities are kept simple for the sake of convenience. Animals of the same Size are roughly equivalent to each other (with some room for Fudge - a monkey is strictly superior to a pig in a battle, for instance, although a pig is superior in a breakfast). Animals of Size 2" or larger can be ridden as steeds, although the sea creatures can be tricky if they lack dorsal studs for mounting.

Most basic animals have a single 1" natural attack ([10.1: Minds](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#1)). Great Beasts can have bigger natural attacks, if their attack appendages are large enough to justify it; the Sizes of Great Beasts vary more than their lesser counterparts.

**Corrupted minifigs** are similar to regular minifigs with one or more horrifying alterations. Some have animal heads, some are made entirely out of bricks, and at the lunatic extreme, some even have noses. While not especially dangerous individually, corrupted minifigs often attack in swarms, overwhelming their victims by force of numbers.

Most corrupted minifigs have hands and can use minifig weapons and tools as well as any regular minifig. Some have an additional Bite or other natural attack. A corrupted minifig with a natural attack can't use it on a turn in which they also use hand weapons or equipment.

If a Jaw-Jaw comes across a living non-Jaw-Jaw minifig who's paralyzed or Disrupted, it can make a Suck attack on the minifig to extract the bodily waste and regenerate one of its own lost limbs. Any minifig leeched in this manner is depleted of vital poop and cannot be used for this purpose again.

Brikfigs are a force of destruction born out of the amorphic nature of ABS itself. Led by strange kult figures and erupting in a dizzying variety of forms and capabilities, brikfigs spread across planets and star systems, seeking to tear all opposition into bite-sized chunks for conversion into additional waves of brikfigs.

Resembling a minifig in only the clumsiest sense, a brikfig has the uncanny ability to reanimate its own disassembled chunks into strange configurations when blown apart, along with other chunks of ABS picked up along the way. A brikfig infestation must be contained and eliminated quickly if there's to be any hope of stopping it.

\* Modular

Attack: Ram

Action: Reconstruct

 |

A brikfig is the most primordial of Monsters: a cyclopean pile of bloks. The most common variety is built of six bricks assembled into the vague form of a minifig and relying on slam attacks to overwhelm its foes. In regions where the brikfigs' power is strongest, often in the presence of large double-sized blocks, there are no limits to the size, form, and abilities of the strange brikfigs that appear.

Brikfigs are **modular**, crumbling and reconstructing themselves as they take damage. Every point of damage inflicted on a brikfig knocks one of its bloks off, causing the usual penalties for lost limbs. Detached bloks become normal bricks again, allowing crumbled brikfigs to be used immediately as a cheap source of building materials.

A brikfig with at least one "arm" can use its Action to **reconstruct** itself or another brikfig, replacing a lost blok with any unattached single brick or corpse of the same size or larger than the lost blok. Regardless of the size or form of the new reconstructed blok, whether a boat hull, dead horse, or standard brick, it behaves like the original blok in all regards, and can be knocked off again by another point of damage.

The bucolic Furbuland civilization was a favorite target of early minifigs and their rapidly developing xenophobia. Long kept at bay by religious fursecution and crusades of the Knights of Yellow Castle 375, the embattled furfig population dwindled to apparent extinction in the 1,989th Rekonstruktion.

Their violent resurgence in the 2,013th Rekonstruktion caught minifig civilization by surprise, as the furfigs' existence had been all but forgotten, preserved only in animated children's propaganda cartoons and cautionary bedtime stories about the horrors of Peace and Friendship. The new furfig descendants, bred for war and hungry for vengeance on their probably-delicious minifig oppressors, inherited none of the Peace-loving spirit that made their forebears such easy targets.

Attack: Natural Attack

 |

Furfigs are minifigopomorphized animals with the bodies of minifigs and the heads (and sometimes other parts) of beasts.

Furfigs take on some of the abilities of their animal relatives where appropriate, including a single natural attack and an occasional alternate movement type. These are usually obvious - a rhinofig has a Ram attack, a birdfig has Flying movement and a Bite attack, and a stingrayfig has Swimming movement and a Sting attack, for instance. For some furfigs, the nature of their natural attack may be up to the game fiction and player negotiation; an eldritch squidfig's face tentacles might be treated as a Claw attack with a Grab, or a Sting attack with paralytic Poison to render victims helpless for convenient brain consumption, depending on what kind of squidfig the players have occupying their vulnerable minds.

[Figures of Unusual Size](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/10.htm#fus)

Like Humans, minifigs whose body sizes vary even slightly from the perfect airbrushed boxcover photo ideal are treated as monsters. Ranging from tiny munchfig Vermin to towering giantfigs, mini-sized figs view these non-mini figs less with horror than with disdain, treating them as disposable weapons, beasts of burden, or snacks.

Large weapons carried by large figures keep their basic weapon stats, but can be wielded in hand and swung around the way minifigs swing around weapons built for their own proportions. A bigfig might wield a pair of minifig Two-Handed Weapons as if they were sabers. A brutefig might rip a 4" tree out of the ground to swing two-handed like a club. A large enough giantfig might hold an armored tank in each hand to fire like pistols while riding two others as roller skates.

**Munchfigs** are a magikally created race of half-figs, spawned from the mixed genetik material of ancient protofigs, living minifigs, and fried chicken legs. Cheap and easily summoned, they serve in wizards' laboratories as diminutive servants and, periodically, snacks.

Despite having no apparent hands, munchfigs are able to lift and carry a single small-sized minifig weapon or equipment item on their head, making them useful as gophers and edible snack trays.

Munchfigs are **edible**. Grabbing and eating a munchfig within arm's or bite's reach costs no Action for allied and friendly creatures. Opposing creatures can also eat munchfigs if they can successfully Grab one; this Grab costs an Action as usual. Friendly or not, eating a munchfig is instantaneous and free, and a creature can chomp up a held munchfig at any time.

A creature who eats a munchfig gains the ability to re-roll a single die in one of its own die rolls. This ability can only be used once, and the effect wears off at the end of the creature's following turn if not used.

It's technically legal to have a flying green one-headed Dragon that breathes fire, but such a generic version is a wasted opportunity in a system that allows for a three-headed transparent purple Dragon phasing through dimensions to breathe cones of shrapnel and lethal fireworks displays, or a no-headed floating eyeball Dragon with nine other eyes on eyestalks that each shoot different breath weapons that are really gaze weapons because eyestalks don't have mouths and it's not completely clear that this thing is really a Dragon at all.

BrikThulhu exists outside the confines of any rule system, and the effects of his presence in a battle are impossible to predict.

The lives and suffering of minifigs are irrelevant to BrikThulhu, existing only as grist for his cephalopodian schemes. Minifigs are the fetishized plastic bait that BrikThulhu wriggles to hook the obsessions of susceptible Humans on whose sanity he feeds.

Seduced away from devoting their short lifespans and resources to having fulfilling relationships or improving the world, Humans who find themselves caught in the slow constriction of BrikThulhu's nine infinitely-branching tentacles compulsively sacrifice their money and psychological health on inert but ever-growing piles of brightly colored plastic. No bins of bricks, no sacks of dice, no host of minifigs can ever be enough to satisfy BrikThulhu's victims, even as their friends and relations and employers and credit rating agencies recoil from the effects of their crippling fixation. All minifigs love and celebrate BrikThulhu for the Human attention he brings them, even as they find themselves tortured and murdered by his inevitable cultists among their ranks.

Only BrikThulhu has the sovereign power to roll the incomprehensible **Action ![](https://brikwars.com/rules/2020/images/dice/d20-icon-20-sn.gif "Action d20")** , allowing him to operate on the Human plane. BrikThulhu uses this power to sabotage die rolls, derail plotlines, corrupt hard drives, and add watermarks to online image hosting services, because the strength of a Human's addiction is powered by the depth of suffering they endure for it. BrikThulhu ensures that critical pieces are only available in two hundred fifty dollar playsets, and once purchased, can then never be found when they're needed. It's BrikThulhu who allies with the family cat to bring prized constructions crashing down, causing rare pieces to vanish eternally, and pointy pieces to reappear days later underneath the Humans' bare footsteps.

Not only does BrikThulhu consume Human sanity, he has the power to re-inflict this **Ensanity** on minifigs by his mere presence. All minifigs bearing witness to BrikThulhu are struck cripplingly sane, incapacitated by the intolerable comprehension of their true nature as chattel plastic toys.
