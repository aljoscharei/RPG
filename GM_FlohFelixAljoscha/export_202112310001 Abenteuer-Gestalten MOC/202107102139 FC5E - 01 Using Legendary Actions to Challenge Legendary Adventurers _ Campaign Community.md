# FC5E01 Using Legendary Actions to Challenge Legendary Adventurers

**Using Legendary Actions to Challenge Legendary Adventurers**
Action economy imbalance is an issue that plagues combat encounters at all levels of play in D&D 5e. This problem exacerbates at the higher-tiers of play where the party has access to regular uses of their bonus action, reaction, and powerful area of effect (AoE) spells.
A simple solution for such legendary adventurers is to equip your creatures with [Legendary Actions!](https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/legendary_creatures/) These additional actions will bridge the action economy gap between the party and creatures and make combat more challenging as a whole.
Legendary Actions can serve many purposes:

*   Increase damage output
*   Improve survivability
*   Assist in battlefield control
*   Support the creature’s allies

Each Legendary Action should increase the creature’s combat effectiveness. This will make your high level combats more challenging and require PCs to consume more resources.
Legendary Actions raise your adventure's stakes and get your players to respect the danger it entails.
**Before We Begin...**
We first need to consider the creature’s needs.
Read the desired creature’s statblock and determine its strengths and weaknesses. In doing so, you’ll recognize gaps in the creature’s statblock that you can close.
For instance, if the creature is a slow melee-attacker, you could give it a Legendary Action that grants extra movement to ensure it’s always close to its target.
This is also the time to mull around the idea of making a flavorful special ability as one of the creature’s Legendary Actions. However, not every creature needs a unique ability in their Legendary Actions list. Recycling actions from the creature’s statblock is perfectly fine and even encouraged!
**Design a Set of Legendary Actions**
Now it’s time to put pen to paper!
Legendary Actions should always add flavor to the creature. Find ways to showcase the creature’s unique abilities and characteristics while still giving it the desired mechanical benefits.
Such benefits may include:

1.  Increasing their or their allies’ AC
2.  Healing themselves or their allies
3.  Giving the creature more movement
4.  Increasing their damage output
5.  Crowd controlling the creature’s enemies

From there, circle back to your findings of the creature’s strengths and weaknesses. Select one area from this list that you wish to improve upon.
Next, outline a Legendary Action that will fit this need or highlight this strength. While this sounds difficult, it’s actually not. Oftentimes, the work has already been done for you.
The name of the game here is to recycle. Look at the regular Actions the creature has and determine what 1-3 additional uses of that action could do for the creature each Round.
Potential Actions that could be used as Legendary Actions:

1.  Movement
2.  A Weapon Attack
3.  A spell or Cantrip
4.  One of the creature’s unique actions

Here’s a freebie. At least one of your Legendary Actions for every creature should be a 1-cost attack Action in the form of one of the creature’s Cantrips or a single Weapon Attack.
I also believe every creature should also have at least one movement Legendary Action or a crowd-control Legendary Action. These actions help you break out of a sticky situation in a pinch.
Once you’ve outlined your Legendary Action you’re ready to move onto the next step, assigning a cost to the Legendary Action. This is a simple concept. The more powerful the action, the more it costs.
For example, movement equal to the creature’s speed is a one-cost Action. An Action that allows the creature to Disengage and then move their speed is a two-cost Action.
Once a cost has been assigned, the Legendary Action is complete barring any balance changes you might make.
Potential balance issues you may run into by adding Legendary Actions to a creature are:

1.  The creature’s damage output per round is too high for the intended CR
2.  The creature will heal too rapidly or the healing is negligible
3.  The action’s AC bonus is too high or too low

Repeat this process until you have three to five total actions. You want to stay in this range as it offers you plenty of options, but not so many that you will bog the game down with a ton of new mechanics. I aim for closer to three than five.
**The Finishing Touches**
Review your creature’s Challenge Rating (CR) while taking into account its new Legendary Actions. The extra damage and survivability they grant will increase its CR. [Take a look at this table](https://old.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2nn6ld/the_monster_quick_stats_by_cr_table/) or the table in the DMG on pg. 274 to get an idea of where your creature stands.
Tweak your Legendary Actions to raise or lower your creature’s CR. Once you’ve hit your desired CR, the creature is ready for game night!
Now that we have the basics down, let’s look at a few examples I’ve come up with using some high-CR creatures from the 5e SRD.
**Example [[1:]] [An Archmage](https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/monsters/archmage/)**
Cantrip: The archmage casts a cantrip.
Arcane Retreat (Costs 2 Actions): The archmage teleports to a location within 30 ft that they can see.
Quake (Costs 3 Actions): Each creature within 15 feet of the archmage must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 thunder damage and is pushed 30 feet away and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.
**Example [[2:]] [A Pit Fiend](https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/monsters/pit_fiend/)**
Fiendish Blow: The pit fiend makes a melee weapon attack with their Mace.
Unending Hunger: The pit fiend makes a melee weapon attack with their Bite.
Stampede (Costs 3 Actions): The pit fiend moves in a 30 ft. line. Attacks of Opportunity cannot be made against the pit fiend. Any creature it passes through must succeed on a DC 22 Strength save or take 6d6 damage and be knocked prone.
**A Legendary Conclusion**
Legendary actions help you create challenging high-level combat encounters in D&D 5e. They are not reserved for boss fights, either. You can slap them onto a creature or two in a run-of-the-mill combat encounter to spice things up.
Design Legendary Actions that bridge creature ability gaps and showcase its strengths to drain party additional resources.
