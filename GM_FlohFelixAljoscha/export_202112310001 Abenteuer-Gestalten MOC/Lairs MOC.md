# Lairs platzieren
Realistisch gucke ich mir an, welche monster nächste session drankommen sollten, dann platziere ich deren lairs in die Umgebung falls die PCs nochmal durchkommen. Nachteil ist, dass sedentary monster nicht drankommen sollte. Weil sie zu hause sitzen.

- System um zu bestimmen, wie weil monster sich weg von zu Hause bewegen:
	- The main question to ask when constructing wandering monster tables is what the range of each monster is. This question can be answered, or at least approximated, using the %-in-lair number. OSE does not include this as part of the monster stat block, but OSRIC (and other systems) do use these numbers (note that OSRIC calls it the “lair probability” number).
	- If using the subhex system the %-in-lair number can be used as follows:
		- ➢ If the number is 100% the monster will not be encountered elsewhere in the hex and will only be encountered in their lair. Ex. Crypt things.
		- ➢ If the number is between 1 and 99% the range of the creature will be a number of hexes equal to 1 plus the number of times the percentage can be multiplied by 2 before reaching 100.
	- Example 1. Bugbears have a lair probability of 25%. They can be found in their lair hex (25%), the next ring of hexes (50%), and the third ring of hexes (100%), bounded by the black line. See the map, below.
	- Example 2. Goblins have a lair probability of 40%. They can be found in their initial hex (40%) and the first ring (80%) of six hexes immediately surrounding the central hex (bounded by the purple line).
	- Example 3. Grimlocks have a lair probability of 75%. They will only be found in the central hex.
- If no lair probability is given it means the creature is nomadic and will move on from the indicated hex 1d12 weeks after the adventurers first enter the hex.
- Giants (humanoids of ogre-size or larger, large dinosaurs, etc.) and flying creatures have their range doubled. Giant flying creatures (such as rocs, dragons, etc.) have their range quadrupled.
- As a general rule, the greater the range of a creature, the more likely the given monster type is to be found within an adjacent hex – and the greater the chance the creature will be on the wandering encounter table there. Hill giants are more likely to be encountered within one adjacent hex than kobolds, since hill giants have a greater range, so if the Referee has to choose between one of the two to add it makes sense to add the hill giants.
