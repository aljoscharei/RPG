Travel and Exploration are very different!
form Dael Kingsmill and Bardig Broadcast

Personify landscape or make like animal colors 
Focus in on several aspects a hawn clouds etc

Travel: Segments of description then encounter
Simpler. Track maybe time maybe gritty realism mechanic. Short rest 8 hrs-> less superhero videogamey. Only half spell slots. Rations: hier egal. No random encounters. Focused purpose. No Random stuff. Plan it normally. Covering distance- here bonding roleplay sing songs drink, walking songs by bard. Character progression. Montage travel from lotr rpg. Zee bashew. Skip?

Exploration: enticement information deficit, click bait. Dont say there is a ruin. Smoke rising in the east hulking shadow, eere song, glimmer, 
Bait to make players use up resources. Random encounters: monster, bandit tolls flash flood mysterious castle that appears overnight. If more stuff than ever in game: tiles that they can flip around. 

Resource management: Time rations carrying capacity, spells, torches etc

You dont know if you can take the same way back. Is food going to last?

Exploration needs a goal, let PCs see things vaguely from afar
put in a mountain early! so you can show many locations maybe note on a vague map

Travel: clear goal. no resource management, roleplay camp scene maybe one random encounter, done
Exploration: resources are important

If exploration: then exploration is also central
