# 11: Traps in Combat

**Danger Abound! Using Traps in Combat**
Traps often serve as resource-draining obstacles spread out in the hallways of dungeons.
While this is a fine usage for traps, it’s not engaging.
But one way to make traps more interesting is to include them in your combat encounters. This increases the encounter’s difficulty and makes traps fun and interactive.
**What Traps Bring to the Table**
Traps add challenges for the party to tackle in the heat of battle.
Upon locating it they'll have more decisions to make. Do they disable the trap, avoid it, or leverage it against the enemy?
Even a mundane or simple trap becomes a battlefield control objective to fight over.
Traps should always have a thematic reason for being present. Don’t include a trap just to include a trap.
Think of why it’s present in the middle of a skirmish. Therefore it’s both thematic and obvious for the party to assume its presence.
Traps should always add to the fight. They shouldn't be mere obstacles.
**Trap Mechanics in 5e**
Pages 120-123 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide contains all the information you need regarding traps in 5e such as:

*   Average damage
*   Saving throw DCs
*   Attack bonus thresholds
*   An array of sample traps to use and tweak as desired

5e has two types of traps: magical and mechanical. In general, both are detectable by **Perception Checks** or **Passive Perception.**
The key difference between them is how they're disabled.
Disabling mechanical traps requires a check using **Thieves' Tools.**
Disabling magical traps requires an **Arcana Check.** Some magical traps are only detectable via spells such as [Detect Magic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Detect%20Magic#content), **Passive Arcana,** or an **Arcana Check.**
**The Map’s Impact**
The size of the map determines how many traps you can add.
Use the following guidelines for battlemap trap placement:

*   Small: 1 trap
*   Medium: 1-2 traps
*   Large or Huge: 3+ traps

Traps limit usable space. Adding too many traps will hinder the creatures’ movement as much as the party’s.
This isn't ideal. Traps are initially added to assist your creatures, not hinder them.
The battlemap's theme will dictate the traps you use as well. For example, a wizard's tower would be full of magical traps such as wards that trigger a [Fireball.](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Fireball#content)
**What’s its Function?**
Traps come in three flavors: damage, crowd control, and battlefield control.
Damage traps exist to attack the target or call for a saving throw to avoid taking damage.
Some examples include:

1.  Swinging Axes
2.  Hidden Darts
3.  Spinning Blades

A subsection of damage traps is AoE damage. These traps have a massive damage potential but come with the risk of harming your creatures too.
Some examples include:

1.  Fireball Traps
2.  A Spiked Pit
3.  An Indiana Jones-esque Rolling Ball

Crowd control traps impose conditions like Paralyzed, Restrained, and Poisoned, lowering the party’s damage output and weakening them for your creatures.
Some examples include:

1.  Snares
2.  Poisoned Dart Traps
3.  Falling Net Traps

Battlefield control traps inhibit movement throughout the battlefield. Place these traps in locations your creatures can leverage for battlefield control.
Some examples include:

1.  Pitfalls
2.  Grease traps that create difficult terrain
3.  Pressurized air traps for displacing movement
4.  Poisonous gas traps that hinder line of sight

Traps can belong to multiple categories. For example, a poisonous gas trap provides battlefield control and AoE damage.
Traps should synergize with your creatures and fill in any gaps in the encounter you might have.
For example, if your creatures lack crowd control, throw in a falling net trap to restrain the party.
**Selecting a Trap**
DMG pages 122-123 contain a variety of sample traps. They're usable as-is but can also work as foundations for your creations.
The tables on pg 121 of the DMG for attack bonus, damage, and saving throw thresholds are invaluable for homebrewing traps.
These thresholds have three levels of difficulty:

*   Setback
*   Dangerous
*   Deadly

Keep these in mind as you build your traps. Deadly encounters may not need a Deadly trap. A Setback or Dangerous trap may be a sufficient challenge.
Always consider your creature's needs when selecting a trap.
For example, if the encounter lacks damage, throw in a damage-dealing trap.
**How to Use the Trap**
In most scenarios, your creatures will be aware of the existence of the trap.
Resourceful creatures should leverage this knowledge by luring the party into the traps.
One way of doing so is by kiting the party. The creatures act as bait to lure them into the traps.
This is an excellent method to chip away at the party’s well-armored frontline units.
Most traps take time to rearm themselves. Keep track of these timers.
Your creatures can use this rearming time to their advantage, such as by using this time to reposition while the party tip-toes around the map.
Many traps, such as magical glyphs and wards, are single-usage traps. They're often more powerful due to their limited usage.
**What if the Party Knows?**
All parties should have a clue that a trap is present in the encounter.
Yet, only perceptive parties can pinpoint the location of a trap. Once they've done so, they can use it to their advantage.
For example, the party might shove your creatures into the traps, pitting your creations against each other.
Even if the party is avoiding your traps, your creatures can still use them. In this scenario, the traps become areas of the map the party won’t step foot on.
Ergo, your creatures control these areas of the map uncontested.
**Pitfalls and Plunder

![trap-lesson-treasure-room-21x20-png.1571](./resources/202107102159_FC5E_-_11__Traps_in_Combat___Campaign_Community.resources/trap-lesson-treasure-room-21x20-png.1571)

**
The party enters the room from the south. Here they see a bare room with creatures scattered throughout the northern part of the room.
The lever in the northeast is visible, tipping them off that there’s something hidden in here.
There are two traps in this room. The first is a hidden spiked pit (DMG pg 122-123) in the southeast corner.
Use your creatures to push the party into the southeast corner of the room to trigger this trap.
The waterslide trap is trickier to use but much deadlier. A false floor (DC 15 Perception Check) disguises it and gives way when the lever is thrown.
Creatures standing there plummet 30 ft. into a rushing river which pushes them through a tunnel. They’ll arrive in a room one floor below in 5 rounds.
Position one or two artillery creatures near the lever. That way you have damage-dealers that can attack from afar and pull the lever at a moment's notice.
Both of these traps can split the party making this encounter very dangerous.
**A Designer of Deadly Obstacles**
Traps are more than skill challenges in-between rooms. When used in combat they add another layer of challenge to the encounter.
Traps come in all shapes and sizes. A trap can fill any gap in your encounter.
However, traps shouldn’t just fill a gap. They should be flavorful additions that enhance the combat encounter.

**Worksheet Activity - Battle in the Haunted Mines**
Your party has been tasked with clearing out a haunted mine of all its undead horrors. Use the provided battlemap and add some thematic traps to it to enhance the fight.

**How To Summary**

1.  Small = 1
2.  Medium = 1-2
3.  Large+ = 3+

2.  Traps must fit the theme of the map and adventure to help convey the setting

1.  AoE damage traps deal damage in an area

2.  Crowd Control - Impose a condition on the party to weaken them
3.  Battlefield Control - Inhibit movement in a portion of the battlefield

1.  Consider the difficulty of the encounter and consult DMG pg 121-123 for trap difficulty information
2.  Use traps to prop up the creatures’ weaknesses

1.  Lure the party into the traps
    
    1.  Be careful for them shoving creatures into them
    2.  Goad the party into moving around the traps, expending extra movement
    
    1.  Single-use traps are done after they’re triggered
    2.  Multi-use traps’ recharge timer can be leveraged by the creatures for unrestricted movement or trapping the party in them as they reset
