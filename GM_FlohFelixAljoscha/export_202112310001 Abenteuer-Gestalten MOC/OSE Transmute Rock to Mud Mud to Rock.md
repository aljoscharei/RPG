This spell creates a 1 hex deep morass of mud. The mud may be placed anywhere within 6 hexes of the caster. Units entering the mud are mired and may not move for 1 combat round. The mud lasts until dried with control weather or transmute mud to rock. This spell can be cast before battle, during set-up, to place 1 hex of mud within 6 hexes of the caster. Surprised armies may not transmute rock to mud before battle.

This spell changes a volume of natural, uncut, unworked rock into an equal volume of mud. The volume transformed can be up to up to 3,000 square feet across and up to 10' deep. Magical stone is not affected by the spell, nor are building, bridges, and other structures made of worked stone.

Transmute rock to mud is most commonly cast in preparation for a pitched battle to create fields of nearly impassable ground. Creatures entering the area of the mud become mired in the deep morass. Mired creatures are slowed to 1/10th their normal movement speed and suffer a -2 penalty to AC.

If the spell is cast underground on a cave's rock ceiling, the mud immediately falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool, forming a mire (as above). The falling mud deals 8d6 points of damage to creatures in the area, half damage if they make a saving throw versus Blast. At the Judge's discretion, transforming a large volume of ceiling rock in a cave can precipitate a wider cave-in as the area's structural integrity becomes compromised.

Mud created by this spell remains such until the duration expires or the reverse of this spell (transmute mud to rock) restores the rock to its original substance. The volume transformed by the reversed version is identical, but the duration of the transmutation is permanent. When mud becomes rock, the shape of the area may be different, as the mud may have moved or shifted.
