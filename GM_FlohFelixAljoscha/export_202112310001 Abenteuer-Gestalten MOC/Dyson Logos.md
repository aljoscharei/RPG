"Cleverly" named on the primary current purpose of this old sinkhole on the outskirts of Lautuntown in the hills of Pantesh - dead goblin hole is where prisoners are tossed when they aren't needing to face "justice" in more civilized areas. This is mostly raiders from the local goblin tribes and those locals and visiting people who decide to join or aid these lawless little monsters.

The entrance by the top of the stairs is walled and gated and guarded by a couple of townsfolk at any time - and a few of the volunteers are exceptionally cruel so those still living within the pit keep away from the doors. The walls of the hole are thick with edible mosses and fungi, and the water at the bottom filters up from below and is usually quite clean except right after a major rainfall. This allows those who don't die being thrown into the pit (or encountering the denizens of the pit) to survive down here for some time.

The four levels of dead goblin hole each have their own residents. Many of the side caves have rusty metal scrap around from when this was an actual prison (and one cell is maintained on level 3 as a defensive structure for whatever group is living there at the time). 

And of course, it turns out that the bandits recently thrown into the hole are actually the prince-in-exile of a nearby city-state and a few of his companions... and if someone could find them and break them out that would set up a legitimate claim to the throne...

# Goblin Severs
[[goblin-canals-above.png]]
[[goblin-canals-below.png]]
	Once part of the canals that kept the incredible graveyard of Graven-Tosk from flooding, the deep stone-walled canals have slowly collapsed over the years and are now a series of narrow tunnels with narrow gaps above in some cases. On the surface, this area is a set of hills that bound the south end of Graven-Tosk and the five smaller hills each support a towering 15 to 25 foot stone monolith. One of these monoliths appears to be sentient and speaks in a very slow, gravelly voice, warning intruders away from the area. Between these hills are cracks and gaps usually a foot or so wide that look down on the canal tunnels below. In the centre of these hills is a larger hole that looks down over a pool in the central room below.
	The canals proper are typically entered via the outflow of the waterways through an archway at the south end of the tunnels. The waterways enter the tunnels through old rusted grates at the north end of the map. The tunnels themselves, tainted by the weirdness of Graven-Tosk, are home to a number of foul goblins, and weird environmental effects.
	The central chamber contains a slow-moving pool of befouled water surrounded by what appears to be the mouldering and fungal-infested remnants of an ancient library and a single massive mushroom with a number of “goblins in sacks” growing from under the crown. Other sections of the tunnels contain an overflow of colourful mushrooms; a “garden” that grows without any real amount of light populated by an albino deer and rabbit; a section with the sound of ringing bells (but no bells) and other miscellaneous weirdness.

[[drow-spire-patreon-revised.png]]
- Troll Stalagmite Fortress
	- Today’s map is a fairly small stalagmite spire fortress. The spire is surrounded on three sides by a small fortress with a spiral ramp leading up from the fortress into and around the stalagmite. The arrows on the ramp lead upwards with a fairly aggressive angle. 
	- One chamber dominates the interior of the spire – Accessed by visitors from the lower portions of the spire ramp, the family head receives guests and talks to them from the balcony on the next level, a good 40 feet above the floor of the chamber. Further up again are a set of galleries for other family members or assassins to listen in on conversations…

	- The Qune Heresy was an offshoot of the church of Xaeen led by three grand clerics of the church who were quickly exiled and denounced. It holds that Xaeen ascended to immortality from the Mithril Throne of Qune in the years leading up to the creation of the great Zorisz Empire. The three heretics built their own churches in the hinterlands of Zorisz and for one at least, the heresy was brought back into the fold a thousand years later as the State religion of Shu-Qune.
	- But the three grand clerics of the Qune Heresy didn’t live to see the acceptance of their teachings. Instead they died during the height of the Zorisz Empire and were entombed in the understructures of the Grey Temple in the hills of what is now Dehnuk.
	- The semi-intact ruins of the Grey Temple were rediscovered a couple of hundred years ago, but outside interference from the Disciples of the Qune heresy kept the treasure hunters from finding the catacombs beneath. Now this secret society that spans several of the Xaeen churches quietly maintains the understructures and tries to keep the curious at bay.

https://dysonlogos.blog/2016/07/29/wygralaks-hole/
[[wygralaks-hole.jpg]]
	The stony plains of Hesten are pierced here and there with deep near-vertical holes that reach down up to a few hundred feet and are almost all partially filled with stagnant water. Tales of antiquity tell us that these holes were created by drops of acidic blood sprayed from the near-mortal wounding of the godling Askullag when he was struck through the heart by the spear of Wygralak the Slayer. Unfortunately for Wygralak the Slayer, one of these droplets also struck him clear in the centre of his forehead, slaying him and forever tainting and destroying his soul, so foul was the ichor in question.
	
	Several of these pits have caves or other underground accesses to them, but the most important for today’s post is the one named after the Slayer himself – Wygralak’s Hole.
	
	A ramp and stairs have been cut into the walls of the hole leading down into the shade beneath the plains of Hestern, past ta cave and a set of doors, and then bridges across the narrow end of the hole to access two more doorways. These caves and doorways lead to interior spaces that are a mix of natural and worked stone, and are said to be home to the head of Wygralak’s Spear (or his actual head, depending on the story).
	
	Of course, the caves are trapped and home to sinister magics, further encouraging the tales of the treasures hidden down here.


Phuktal Monstery
A couple of months ago this photoshopped image showed up on google+ with a challenge for the mappers present to take a try at it.
![[kabus-retreat-photoshop.jpg]]

It’s a bad photoshop of the beautiful Phuktal Monastery in India with a waterfall added to it for ridiculous effect. However, based on it I drew the following simplification on my isometric pad:

[[the-roots-of-the-world-web.jpg]]
Like the Circle of Doom I posted on Friday, this is another pencil-drawn map I made last year (and used in the same Labyrinth Lord / AEC campaign) and didn’t want to post until I had stocked it. The Roots of the World were where the party had to collect a water-based artifact (they got the fire artifact in **[Ember Crag](https://rpgcharacters.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/ember-crag-a-recurring-volcanic-dungeon/ "Ember Crag – a recurring volcanic dungeon")**). The place is flooded knee-deep in water (with the massive central area having much deeper sections), and the central area is a massive cavern with regularly spaced stone columns. However, these columns are the “Roots of the World” and any attack that strikes them makes the whole place shake and rumble (everyone in the dungeon makes a save versus Petrification / Paralysis or cannot move for one round).

The Roots are home to a lot of Toads (**[see the racial class I posted last year](https://rpgcharacters.wordpress.com/2010/10/16/toads-a-bx-dd-racial-class/ "Toads – a B/X D&D Racial Class")**), along with some massive toad ogres (using Ogre stats, except they can make a special attack once every six rounds that stuns everyone within 120 feet who fails a save versus paralysis – this is usually a massive bellow, but could also be slamming the ground with their massive clubs or something similar). The southern section (the old fort on the southern plateau) is currently home to a small team of hostile gnomish explorers.

When I ran this, that’s basically all the notes I had, the rest I made up as I went along. So I recommend you do the same. Alternately, you could actually take the time to stock the Roots of the World and I’ll post your version (or link to it if you post it to your own blog).



[[temple-of-rains-patreon.png]]
At the edge of the Falleck Promontory overlooking the Dry Badlands of Korush, a series of bizarre (and probably unnatural) stone pillars reach 60 feet up from the dry floor of the land and support a series of small bridges that in turn lead to the ruins of the Temple of Rains. Some say rebuilding the temple will bring water back to the badlands, but most believe the temple was built here in the first place because water is so rare.
