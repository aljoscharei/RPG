	- Morale Roll Results
		- <2 **Rout**: The unit immediately routs off the battlemap and is removed from play.
		- **Flee**: The unit immediately becomes disordered (if not already), changes its facing towards its own battlemap edge, and immediately retreats a number of hexes equal to its hustling movement rate in that direction. If a fleeing unit cannot complete its retreat, it is considered routed and removed from play.
		- **Waver**: The unit immediately becomes disordered, if not already. If already disordered, it retreats one hex towards its own battlemap edge. If the unit cannot complete its retreat, it flees (as above).
		- **Stand Firm**: The unit remains steady. No effect.
		- **Rally**: The unit rallies under the pressure of battle. If the unit is disordered, the disordered token is removed. If the unit is not disordered, it recovers one lost uhp and, if unthreatened, may advance one hex towards an enemy unit.
		- Retreats, where necessary, follow the same rules as those caused by shock rolls.  [[202208070936 ACKS Domains at War Battles#Retreating]]
