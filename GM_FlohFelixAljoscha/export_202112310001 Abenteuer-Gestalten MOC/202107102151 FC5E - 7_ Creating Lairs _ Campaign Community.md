**Creature Lairs, the Home Field Advantage**

Boss fights offer the thrilling climax of an adventure or dungeon. It’s when all the pieces come together and the party gets to square-off against their fated foe.

However, sometimes boss fights don't feel epic enough. Legendary Actions help to solve the mechanical issue. Yet what about the theme and the flavor of the boss fight?

Lairs are the solution. They convey both the unique flavor and thrill of a boss fight while also adding mechanical teeth to the creature’s arsenal.

**What Makes a Lair?**

A lair is a unique room in a dungeon or an area within a locale. It’s the Legendary Creature’s home turf.

Lairs are created by the creature to suit their needs, using their magical powers, ingenuity, or vast wealth to do so.

A lair gives the DM an in-game reason to craft a battlemap best-suited for their big boss, giving the creature an inherent tactical advantage based on their abilities.

Lairs also give mechanical advantages. A creature within their lair is able to use a single Lair Action each turn, giving them a boost to their action economy.

**Lair Action Mechanics**

The full lair rules are on pg 11 of the _Monster Manual (MM)_ or pg 260 of [the 5e SRD.](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)

A Lair Action is part of a legendary creature’s kit. However, they're only usable while the creature is in their lair.

Lair Actions are separate from the creature’s initiative order and happen on initiative count 20. Keep in mind that Lair Actions lose initiative ties with creatures.

The creature also must not be incapacitated or be unable to use actions.

You can use one Lair Action per turn. There are limitations with regard to how often you can use a unique lair action.

Here are the two limitations types in the _MM_l:

*   Each unique Lair Action is usable once per Short or Long Rest.
    Super powerful Lair Actions use these limitationse.g. Sphinx
    
*   You cannot use the same Lair Action two rounds in a row.
    e.g. Gold Dragon
    

**Constructing the Lair**

A lair is a unique location. It’s the place a legendary creature is most comfortable in with regards to fighting in it as well as living in it.

An evil wizard’s lair, for example, might include a laboratory brewing unknown potions. They might also have rare arcane trinkets and books strewn about. All these elements tell the party a bit about the wizard. They're also useful to the wizard in a fight.

Your creature’s lair should help convey more information about the creature to the party. Use descriptive words to paint a broad picture of the creature to the party.

For instance, what the day in the life of the boss monster might look like. A resourceful party could learn a lot about the creature's weaponry by seeing bones of their prey strewn about their lair.

**Optional: Include Regional Effects**

Regional Effects are effects that persist around the lair. They show the impact of the lair on the ecosystem.

Regional Effects are harmless effects. They provide ambiance for the setting and foreshadow the creature to the party.

For example, a Regional Effect of a vampire’s lair is that there is a creepy fog surrounding the area around the lair.

They are also optional. It might make sense for some creatures to have many regional effects while others might not need any.

**Brainstorm Lair Actions**

The next step is to brainstorm some Lair Actions. For starters, take a look at the creature’s stat block. See what their strengths are and think of how you can showcase them.

Legendary Creatures are unique types of creatures. They boast powerful actions and traits inspired by the creature’s background.

Lairs and Lair Actions should assist the creature in using their unique abilities.

Another source of inspiration is the lair itself. Lairs have elements that set it apart from the rest of the location they’re housed in. Think of how the creature could leverage these elements in combat.

Draft a few ideas before you begin adding mechanics to them. You want a final list of 2-4, but feel free to draft some extras.

**Add the Mechanics**

Chop down your list of Lair Actions into a set of 2-4. Prioritize keeping actions that make combat more engaging rather than flat number increases.

Create 2-4 Lair Actions that do any of the following:

*   Direct Damage\*
    Make an attack or call for a saving throw to avoid damage.
    The damage output should be close to one of the creature’s actions.Can be Aoe or Single Target
    
*   Buffs or Healing
    Enhance the creature.e.g. Grant the creature advantage on all their attacks on their next turn.
    
*   Battlefield control
    Gain a strategic advantage over the party using the terrain.e.g. Create an area of difficult terrain near or around the creature.
    
*   Debuffs
    Weaken your foes.e.g. A creature makes Constitution saving throws at disadvantage for the next minute.
    
*   Movement
    Grant the creature additional movement or hinder the party’s movemente.g. If a creature fails a Wisdom saving throw they must use their movement to move away from their foe.
    

\* Limit the number of direct damage-dealing Lair Actions to one slot. They're less interesting to play against. Also, extra sources of direct damage makes balancing the creature's CR difficult.

Each Lair Action should bring something different to the table. That’s the spirit of their usage limitations. The tone of each round will change depending on what unique action was used.

Design Lair Actions that enhance the creature or create challenges mid-fight. Lair Actions that buff the creature or weaken the party’s abilities or positioning are the best options for creating mid-fight challenges.

**Final Polish and Balance**

As with Legendary Actions, Lair Actions make your creatures more powerful. Ergo, you might need to adjust the creature’s CR.

Consider which Lair Actions enhance the creature’s stats or damage output. Then, reference [this table](https://old.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2nn6ld/the_monster_quick_stats_by_cr_table/) or the table in the _Dungeon Master’s Guide_ on pg. 274 to adjust CR.

If you have a specific CR in mind, adjust your Lair Action numbers to fit your goal.

**Example: Goblin Boss Lair**

The goblin boss stat block is on page 166 of the MM.

**Regional Effects:** The area within 300 ft. of the goblin boss's cave is devoid of animals. Rotting corpses and garbage litter the area.

**Lair Actions (each can be used once per short or long rest):**

*   The goblin boss tips over a bucket of foul-smelling filth. Each non-goblinoid creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or make attacks at disadvantage on their next turn.
*   The goblin boss throws a sack of cheese at the party, summoning a Swarm of Rats.
*   Goblin underlings roll barrels at a target. The target and every creature within 15 ft. of them must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Lurking Within Our Lair**

The lair is your Legendary Creature’s home territory. Give them both tactical and mechanical superiority when fighting inside of it.

Lairs are also a great way to reward the party’s ingenuity. If they can destroy the lair or coax the creature out of the lair, they’ve neutralized a serious threat when confronting the boss.

Lairs and Lair Actions are fantastic additions to an adventure. They'll add flavor and extra challenge to your adventure's climax.
