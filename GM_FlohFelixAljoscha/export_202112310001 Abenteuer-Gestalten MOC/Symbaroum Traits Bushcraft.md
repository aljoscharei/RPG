Roll Vigilant to find Food and Water


The person can read the signs of the wilds, knows what areas to avoid and is used to finding food, water and shelter in harsh environments. While moving through ruins or wilderness, the person can pass a Vigilant test to gather 1D6 rations of food and water per day, or 1D10 rations if that is the personâ€™s sole focus (no movement).

Bushcraft can be acquired multiple times, in which case it can be used in increasingly hostile environments. For example, level I is useful in places such as Bright Davokar and the outskirts of the mountains; level II in Wild Davokar and the deep mountain valleys; level III in Dark Davokar and the Underworld (the Game Master decides). Note that one must have spent a significant period of time in the more demanding environments to benefit from the higher levels of the boon.
