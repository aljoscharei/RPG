	- This hall was built at the behest of Bradrig, summoner of the great devourer, master of the kraken, lord of the seven isles, and so on and so forth. Completed shortly before his death, he would accept petitioners here where a doppelganger would sit on a high throne and pronounce “the will of Bradrig” Upon his death, his six doppelgangers were immediately slain by staff dedicated to exactly that purpose, and the throne in Bradrig’s Hall was replaced with a statue of the summoner of the great devourer.
	- For the last 187 years the hall has been sealed and quiet, but with the return of the kraken to the seven isles, people are returning to the old ways and beseeching the aid of the long-dead Bradrig. And thus the hall will be re-opened! I’m sure no traps were set when the hall was closed up – but just in case, perhaps some hearty adventurers can take up the task instead of a few lowly functionaries of the seven isles?

		- The ruined “well” in the forested hills is well known to hunters in the area as it stands out as an unusual place for such a well (at the top of a hill instead of in one of the valleys). Actually a ventilation shaft for some deeper construction, the space beneath was only discovered recently when part of the hillside was torn away by the roots of a falling tree exposing a massive chamber within and a series of other rooms and spaces damaged by ages of neglect and water. 
		- These five chambers are all that remains of what was obviously a much larger complex at some point. The design was ornate but includes no text in the masonry masking the ancient origins. The structures are large and open, with 20-foot wide corridors and tall arched ceilings, implying that it was built with larger races in mind, or was something quite grand at some point. To confuse matters more, the solitary statue in the alcove of the first grand hall is a 3-foot-tall statue of an octopus.
		- And something is making strange noises below…

		- Dorron’s Tower isn’t so much a tower as an ascending dungeon structure. There are two entrances into the structure – one leads into the buttressed central chamber where Dorron’s Emerald used to sit on a plinth mounted on the central dais. Around the chamber are a number of small “windows” that ascend in a spiral pattern along the walls between the buttresses – each allowing people in the upper chambers to look down upon the central chamber and the emerald.
		- The second entrance leads into these four chambers, each one higher than the last. A fifth chamber rests beyond the fourth, only accessible via a long-hidden (and wizard-locked) secret door, or by climbing the walls of the central chamber to get to the small window into the chamber. This last room has another plinth identical to the one that once held Dorron’s Emerald in the central chamber – and it is still home to an emerald that was magically drawn from Dorron’s Emerald. This “Emerald Bud” is a magical gem that glows with a faint green radiance and has potent curative properties.

		- Named after the sounds of the brook that runs through these caves, the Burbling Subterrane is primarily a series of gallery caverns with a smaller cave complex cut into a memorial in the depths. The first cave is a gallery that almost resembles gapped teeth across the opening, with five gaps between the rocks leading into the cave proper. The brook burbles through these “teeth” to a pool in the second gallery and then down a series of steps to the mushroom chamber beneath.
		- The northernmost cave has been used as a “burial” space by a goblin tribe that once lived nearby. They are long gone, but the bones of many strangely twisted goblins are in the depression in the cave, with a few “mummified” goblins wrapped up in dry and crumbling swathing on the cave floor above them.
		- The one worked area of the Subterrane is a memorial cut into the stone by unknown (presumably dwarven) parties at the end of the great war, with statues of four unknown dwarves wearing bizarre otherworldly equipment. The complete lack of inscriptions or other details leaves this space a mystery.

		- First of all, I definitely have a predilection to having standing stones / pillars / menhirs / etc at the entrances to my five room dungeons. With that out of the way…
		- The Pride’s Circle is a set of standing stones on the edge of the Middlemark Woods. Attached to the circle, but hidden within the woods, is the Temperance Stone, a large “table stone” used for sacrifices and feasts. On the south side of the Temperance Stone is a two-and-a-half-foot gap that leads down a set of stone stairs into a small “dungeon” below. This underground space consists of a small “gallery” chamber with statues of the Oak and Holly Gods and the Goddess beyond them. Side chambers are used for secret rituals and as a tomb for two ancient druids who have never begun to decompose, leading people to believe that they will return to life at some point when needed.

		- The source of the Garnet river is a small spring and stream in the Brock Hills. The spring itself is surrounded by a set of 8 deep red stone pillars that were once of equal height, although two have been shortened by some violent damage. A further four of these pillars run the length of Garnet’s Hall overlooking the spring – evidently, the hall was once at least five feet longer than it currently is, but the front face of the hall has been destroyed and the hall now overlooks the spring like a broken toothy maw.
		- There are four chambers in the hillside around the spring. Counter-clockwise from the lower left, we have a cavernous entrance with a sunken section in the middle. The entrance to the next chamber was once a beautifully decorated archway, the masonry of which still litters the floor. The next chamber has a 15-foot wide shaft in the north end of the ceiling that leads to the upper elements of the hall. Here we have the two-tiered “Priests’ Chamber” and then up three flights of stairs the main hall of Garnet’s Hall that overlooks the spring from 30 feet above.

		- A strange gate to distant lands is under the badlands near Fort Redshield. Stairs lead down to a cavern / sinkhole that is partially open to the sky above. The bottom of the space contains a pool that is refreshed by the rains and occasionally overflows in inclement weather, leading to the flooding of the cavern to the west which has a near-perpetual pool of scummy stagnant water in it. 
		- In the southern cave are a number of near-perfect spheres protruding from the cave walls. These iridescent orbs are inherently magical and are probably the fruit of some bizarre otherworldly mushroom who’s spores came here through the gate…
		- And that brings us to the gate. Massive pillars of bismuth stand 30 feet apart with a strange magical field between them – a portal to other places, other worlds, even other dimensions with the right magics.
