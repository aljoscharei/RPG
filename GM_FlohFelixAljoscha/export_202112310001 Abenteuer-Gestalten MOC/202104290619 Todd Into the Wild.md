# Hex Exploration p 19
compare [[202002270909 On Downtime and Demesnes#Clearing and securing Terrain]]

It is assumed that every hex has a certain number of interesting features such as ruined buildings, toppled monuments, caves, and so forth in addition to monster lairs.[[202002270909 On Downtime and Demesnes#Contents of an uncivilized six-mile hex]] Traveling through a hex only reveals those features on the adventurers’ direct path; traveling (?, not exploration?) within a hex can uncover all of the secrets it contains.

Adventurers can explore the land within a hex, as opposed to merely passing through . Again, there are two options, depending on how populated a hex is with features. If there is only one point of interest within a hex, and the hex is not divided into subhexes, it merely takes a given number of days to search the hex, and a roll is made to determine when the point of interest is encountered. If there are multiple features within a hex it is recommended that the hex be divided into subhexes, and the exploration rate given in terms of subhexes. **In both cases the speed of exploration is based upon terrain and not the party’s movement rate.**

The amount of time it takes to fully explore a hex is dependent upon the terrain, as follows:

➢ Plains/Grassland/Desert: 8 subhexes per day (three days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or 1 subhex every 60 minutes (1 hour).

➢ Hills/Broken/Light Forest: 4 subhexes per day (six days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), 1 subhex every two hours.

➢ Mountain/Heavy Forest: 3 subhexes per day (eight days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or 1 subhex every 160 minutes (2 and 2/3 hours).

➢ Jungle/Swamp: 2 subhexes per day (twelve days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or 1 subhex every four hours.

If a hex consists of multiple terrain types simply determine the length of time it takes per subhex and total those times daily to determine how much the adventurers are able to explore.

Hex exploration can be sped up if the party has an aerial spotter, adjusting exploration times as follows:

➢ Plains/Grassland/Desert: 12 subhexes per day (two days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or one subhex every 40 minutes.

➢ Hills/Broken: 6 subhexes per day (four days to explore an entire 6-mile hex), or one subhex every 80 minutes.

➢ Forest: No reduction in time, although tall features that break the tree-line or gaps in the tree cover will be spotted automatically.

➢ Mountain: 4 subhexes per day (six days to explore an entire hex), or one subhex every two hours.

➢ Jungle/Swamp: No reduction in time, although tall features that break the tree-line or gaps in the tree cover will be spotted automatically.

In order to gain the benefits of an aerial spotter, however, at least 3/4 of the party must be on the ground, whether mounted or on foot. There must, in other words, be boots on the ground.

Hex exploration cannot be sped up by forced marching or increasing the movement rate of the searchers. However, the adventurers could certainly split into multiple parties to increase the area that can be searched, provided they have the numbers to do so.

The following assumptions are made when exploring a hex:

➢ The party starts exploring wherever they enter the hex, and travel in a manner that allows them to pass from sub-hex to sub-hex in the most efficient manner – usually by moving left to right to left, or up then down then up. Of course, the party can declare they’re exploring the hex in any manner they see fit.

➢ **Entering a sub-hex is enough to discover whatever feature or lair is to be found within it, unless it is cunningly concealed, invisible or otherwise difficult to perceive**. In such cases there should be some condition that must be met for discovering the feature (“the Ossified Pyramid is only visible in the light of a full moon”). It is also possible that certain features, especially those of a magical nature, are not noticed until the proper conditions are met.

➢ The adventurers are moving at a rate generally equivalent to cautious dungeon movement; they’ve got decent chances to notice tracks, avoid ambushes, etc.

➢ As a general rule, creatures that lair within a given sub-hex will leave signs of their presence in the ring of sub-hexes immediately surrounding their lair.

➢ For every day spent searching roll for random encounters as per the terrain.

➢ If the party engages in combat reduce the number of sub-hexes that can be explored for the day by one for each encounter, regardless of injuries.

➢ It is assumed that the adventurers camp in the final sub-hex they search for the day. Otherwise, they may, if desired, establish a base camp guarded by mercenaries to use as a relatively safe place to stay (and a place for injured characters to recover). If the party is retreating to a base camp established elsewhere reduce the number of subhexes explored per day by 1. The base camp must either be in the hex being explored or within three miles of that hex.

➢ A base camp is a stationary location to which the adventurers return every night. It allows the party to fortify a single location to be as defensible as possible, as well as provide a location where any injured can recover from wounds through rest, if needed.

Characters have a 1 in 6 chance of discovering any monster tracks when they enter a new sub-hex (rolled once for the party, not each character). If a member of the party is an experienced outdoorsperson or elf this chance is increased to 1-2 in 6. This assumes that there is, in fact, a monster lairing within that specific subhex and that the monster can leave some sort of tracks; it serves to give advance warning that a threat may be lurking within.

If a hex is being cleared to found or expand one’s domain the hex must be kept cleared by regular patrols, or else empty lairs or suitable features may become inhabited again by monsters (see below). Refer to p. 22 for more information on this.

![[Hex Exploration.jpg]]
## Example.
This example assumes no encounters that result in combat. A party starts out exploring a hex that is mostly forest. They explore four subhexes (two full subhexes and four half subhexes) the first day, another four subhexes (three full subhexes and two half subhexes) the second day and another four subhexes (four full subhexes) the third day. At this point they decide to establish a base camp (in subhex 0405), so their explorations thereafter are reduced in scope by one subhex per day since they need to return to base camp at the end of each day. In day four they explore three subhexes (two full subhexes and two half subhexes). The terrain then opens up into grasslands, and they are able to explore seven subhexes on day five, leaving two full subhexes and two half subhexes for day six. The party finishes exploring the hex with five hours left in the day.

## Getting Lost While Exploring a Hex

There still exists a chance to get lost while exploring within a hex, but it is treated differently than getting lost while traveling overland. The assumption is that when a hex is being explored the adventurers are moving at a slower pace, paying close attention to landmarks, notable features, and surveying as they go.

The chances of getting lost while exploring within a hex are half what they are when traveling overland, rounding down. Do not apply modifiers for forced marching or traveling at night, as neither of these can be done during exploration. If the adventurers are being pursued and attempting to evade a foe treat it as normal movement, not exploration.

If the result indicates the adventurers do get lost, this manifests in one of two ways: getting lost, and getting delayed. Actually getting lost while exploring within a hex only occurs on a roll of natural 1. If this occurs roll 1d6 and reference the diagram below to determine which direction they travel in.

![[Hex Getting Lost.jpg]]

If the path the adventurers take brings them to a subhex they have already explored, have the party guide (or most woodswise character) make an Intelligence check. In most instances they must roll their Intelligence or lower on 3d6. In heavy woods, jungles, swamps, and deserts use 4d6. If the check succeeds the adventurer realizes they are lost.

If the adventurers do not realize they are lost upon entering a previously explored subhex roll again to determine the direction in which they head. If they enter *another* previously explored subhex they can roll again, as above. Otherwise, it is handled as below.

If the adventurers enter a subhex that has not yet been explored they do not get a chance to roll to determine if they realize they are lost until the following morning. Note that they may realize this sooner if they have established a base camp and discover they cannot find their way back to it.

Likewise, if the adventurers, in the course of their stumbling about, come upon an easily recognizable feature – such as a structure, road, lake, etc. – they should be able to determine they have gotten turned around.

The other result of a failed roll – the one that happens on any failed result other than a natural 1 – is that the adventurers get delayed. Roll 1d8 to determine how many hours the adventurers lose off of the adventuring day.






# Reddit Lairs Discussion

Dungeon Lairs in OSE

Once again I find myself bogged down in trying to make a dungeon.

  

This time I'm trying to parse out how Dungeon Lairs work, particularly in the Context of Old School Essentials. For context I am a "roll the bones then interpret/massage the results" type of guy. I don't like trying to come up with everything on my own because it never feels right.

  

What is a Dungeon Lair? Is it every room that I roll a Monster & Treasure result for? If not, how do I decide how to place them?

  

Furthermore how does one differentiate a Dungeon Lair from any other room with monsters? I read once that they are "where the monster lives". If so, what about monsters in other rooms? Are they just wandering around? Do they need a home somewhere in the dungeon too?

  

And related to this is treasure. Certain TTs belong in lairs- ok, fair enough. I read on Dragonsfoot once that unguarded treasures belong in Monster & Treasure rooms that aren't designated as Lairs.

  

This is why I suck at running OSR games, I always get caught up in trying to parse this stuff out. Any suggestions?

Generally speaking, most monsters need somewhere to sleep and thus will have lairs. Exceptions would include things like gelatinous cubes and other oozes, which likely spend all their time wandering, unless they are trapped in a secret chamber or something.

  

Wandering monsters in general I tend to think of as existing in kind of a quantum state. They represent either additional members of a tribe or group of the same type of creature on the same or a neighboring level, out on some business such as hunting, scouting, or getting water, or possibly a nomadic hunter or visitor either from outside the dungeon or from an as-yet undefined lower level.

  

Some folks (Dave Arneson was, I think, the original pioneer) draw all their wandering monsters from the pre-defined population of an area or level, and subtract them from that populace. Of course, if the purpose of wandering monsters is to "punish" the players for inefficient time usage by giving them extra encounters which don't have much or any treasure, then you may not want to let them reduce the existing defined numbers of monsters in lairs.

  

As a general stocking guideline, the INTENT as I understand it is that the DM exercises fiat to "thoughtfully place" at least a few major treasures, special tricks, and monster lairs on each level, and then the random tables are used for filling out extra space procedurally. As for how you decide? Good question. If you don't have inspiration for that, maybe start by procedurally generating a level, then pick your favorite spots or monsters and flesh them out a bit. If you've got a dungeon level with, say, 36 rooms, per the stocking table they will break down roughly as follows:

# Dungeon stockkng table

12 "Empty" (though they can still have clues or evidence of monsters or hints of other content in the dungeon), 2 of which have hidden treasure.

  

12 with monsters in them, of which 6 have treasure.

  

6 Special, with some kind of weird or interesting magical effect or trickery to interact with. These I find are always one of the trickiest things to generate because they really call for a lot of creativity. I steal good trick and "special" ideas constantly from modules and people's game reports).

  

6 Traps, 2 of which will be guarding some sort of treasure. These, too, can require some creativity, but stealing shamelessly from modules, blogs and such is a great idea.



- Bigger than that, Courtney Campbell of the Hack & Slash blog also has a huge doc on tricks and traps I highly recommend.

# Process if making a Dungeon  

Ok, so let's say that I have no inspiration whatsoever, but need to generate a dungeon level for my players for the next session or three.

  

Step 1: I will troll through Dyson's Dodecahedron or another online map resource like Donjon or Zorbus, to find or generate a map that strikes me as cool, and has the appropriate number of rooms. Depending on your group and their level of caution, a rate of exploration of 3-5 rooms an hour or roughly a 10-12 encounters (mix of combat, traps, RP, problem solving) in a 3-4 hour timeframe is common, but this is highly variable depending on the group and the efficiency of the players and DM. That 36 above is pretty good.

  

1a) If I have time and inclination, I can alter that map or mash two or more maps together using an image editing application like GIMP.

  

Step 2: Ideally the map itself and/or any evocative text on it (Dyson, for example, loves to give some framing fiction) may have already sparked ideas for specials or monster lairs. If so, great! Place them where they seem appropriate. If not, just roll the bones and start stocking.

  

Step 3: Now that I've got randomly generated content, let's start customizing it. Hopefully some inspiration struck during the random generation, but if not, let's pick, say, 3-4 of those monster + treasure spots, or maybe 3 of the monster lairs with treasure and 1 of the trapped treasures, and add some sauce. Come up with some funky tactics or an interesting personality for a leader monster. Unless your treasure rolls have been really high (the book gives average values for each Treasure Type), give them a couple of extra magic items and some extra loot.

  

Do some math and figure out how much treasure is in the level, in total. **Usually a good pace of advancement has the characters gaining a level roughly every 3-4 sessions**. Aim a little shorter for level 1-2. If it's a starter dungeon, make sure there's enough treasure on the level for a whole party of 6-8 adventurers to at least go from 1st to 2nd level. If you're running OSE, that means (using Fighters as average) in the neighborhood of 12,000-16,000 gp on the level if it's big enough that you expect them to take at least two or three sessions to clear it. 

  

This may seem like a lot, but it's what they need, and they may not find all of it anyway if they don't find the hidden treasures and/or if they make peace with or avoid some of the monsters which have loot.

The Lair is the chamber where the dragon sleeps atop her massive pile of jewels, the cavern or copse where the goblins pitch their camp and keep their loot, or the strongroom where the bandit king keeps his safe full of "tributes" from the surrounding villages. It's the "home base" for a given mob.

Lairs function as a home base for the monsters in the dungeon and are where they store a Treasure Hoard. You use the bigger Number Appearing for a Lair, so a Kobold lair would have 6d10 (33) + some bosses, while a Kobold patrol would have 4d4 (10).

  

It's GM fiat afaik towards whether or not a room stocked has a Lair or a wandering sized population, but the implication is that using the smaller NA means they have no Hoard. If you roll to stock treasure in a room with monsters that wouldn't have any treasure, you stock it with an amount based on the level of the dungeon instead.

  

I tend to place Hoards first then split up the Lair population all over the dungeon level, because even if my party was capable of defeating 8-67 kobolds, that sounds like an absolute nightmare to play out.

A lair can be a single room/cave or an entire dungeon level/cavern. It's up to you to decide. My first suggestion is to use a random dungeon generator, either a book dedicated to the subject like https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/97423/Tome-of-Adventure-Design?term=The+book+of+adventure+des

  

The tome of adventure design, or the random dungeon generator in the back of the 1st edition DMG.
[[201907132204 Tome of Adventure Design MOC]]
  

This book is also good, and one of my favorites: [[Oldskull Dungeon Generator.pdf]]



I would stay away from online random generators, as they take everything away from you creatively. Get yourself some graph Paper and start drawing your dungeon.

  

Have fun storming the castle!

  

PS: A "Lair" is an ambiguous term. Many different monsters can "lair" in the same area. It's more of a difference between small bands of wandering monsters and a higher concentration of them in an area. My home is my "lair" but I wander around my neighbourhood.

###  Lairs
The Filling in the Blanks supplement deals specifically with the generation and placement of features and touches generally on the generation of lairs. This book goes into more detail about the generation of lairs, populating them with creatures, and how monster lairs interact with their surroundings.

  

For the purposes of this book a “lair” is a fixed encounter location containing a roughly homogeneous collection of monsters (or humans). Lairs are considered distinct from dungeons, which tend to contain multiple encounters with traps, many different types of creatures, and require exploration of their own.

  

Note that some monsters – especially more intelligent ones – may have lairs containing more than one type of creature: a goblin village may have wolves or dire wolves that act as mounts and guards. Orc villages have a chance to contain ogres and trolls. Additionally, as distinct from dungeons, lairs tend to be on the surface, although many creatures make use of small cave systems (which may themselves tie into larger dungeon complexes). Finally, a dungeon is often considered a distinct and somewhat insular ecosystem, with inhabitants rarely leaving for the outside world. The residents of lairs are much more likely to venture out into – and be encountered in – the outside world.

  

When determining the number of lairs in a hexcrawl that uses subhexes assume there are 1d6 lairs in every 6-mile hex. As an optional rule, the following can be done with certain terrain types:

  

➢ Roll 1d4 or 1d6–1 for plains, grasslands, clear, and settled terrain. 

➢ Roll 1d8 or 1d6+1 for jungles, swamps, or mountains.

  

If the hex size is smaller than 6 miles the number of lairs can be reduced; if greater than 6 it can be increased.

  

If the Referee is not using subhexes, but rather undivided 6-mile hexes, assume that each hex has a 1-2 in 6 chance of containing a lair. Again, the supplement Filling in the Blanks contains detailed rules for determining the generation of lairs and features that can be used in place of this general rule.

  

The generation of lairs uses tables similar to those used for wilderness encounters, customized to include all potential monsters (the encounter tables found in OSE

  

Core and Advanced monster books do not include entries for sedentary monsters).

  

When placing lairs assume they occupy either a natural hollow, depression, or otherwise hidden or defensible spot in the case of intelligent creatures and animals. Undead, constructs, and other non-intelligent threats don’t necessarily concern themselves with concealment, or even making a semi-permanent home. This is not always the case, however; many undead – intelligent and non – shun light, and will lair in dark crevices, caverns, barrows, dilapidated structures, etc. The encounter tables also includes monsters that are traditionally only found underground; they are labeled as such, and it is assumed that any such result indicates the creature’s lair

is underground or in an isolated, enclosed place like the cellar of a house, etc.

  

The monster entries on the encounter tables are not weighted for strength (often referred to as “Challenge Rating”) nor frequency. It is recommended that the Referee use the “Double Dragon” rule if they want to reduce the number of powerful monsters encountered. This rule calls for rerolling any results that indicate a monster with more than 5 HD, taking the new result regardless of its HD. This rule reduces the number of powerful monsters that will be encountered, effectively weighting the tables toward

  

more moderate threats. Should the Referee want to restrict encounters to creatures in the Core book they can roll a smaller die that fits within the desired range. Conversely, customized placement tables (see Table 6.16 for an example) can be crafted to provide weighted encounters.

  

Each creature table has a number of entries for a given terrain type. The entries are filled first by creatures from OSE Core, then from the Advanced Monster book, and then, when possible, are rounded out using monsters from other (free) OSR sources. Each column indicates which dice are to be rolled to determine the encounter; n a result of “Another source” is indicated the monster will be (1-4) chosen from another source or (5-6) unique.

  

Tables 6.2-6.14 are populated with as many creatures as possible to provide a broad source of varied monsters to place. Should the Referee want to narrow the focus – or is populating a region with a limited number of creatures – Table 6.15 is a blank encounter table. It is divided into fourteen columns, with each containing monsters of a specific type. The frequency of encounter by terrain type (found on Table 6.1) can be transferred over to this blank table, or the Referee can assign numbers as makes sense based on their location. Finally, Table 6.16 gives

  

an example of a regional lair generator. The advantage of using a regional lair placement is that it provides a tighter focus to the types of creatures found in a region while still allowing some variance. On the other hand, it does require more work to populate a table for each region. The “Unique” column in the regional lair placement allows the Referee to provide specific unique lairs; either a new type of creature native to the region, or named creatures (such as Cugrorn, the lich-lord, or Doomlor the dire boar). When a unique creature comes up as a result the Referee should remove its entry from future rolls, either replacing it with another creature or leaving the entry blank, as desired.

  

Intelligent, tool- or magic-using monsters will defend or guard their lair as appropriate, as well as ally with other creatures in the area.

  

Watery Lairs

  

These tables, designed to place creature lairs rather than generate encounters, present an issue when it comes to generating lairs in watery (river, lake, or

  

ocean) terrain. What exactly does that mean? The Referee has several options:

  

➢ It can be an actual lair. Aquatic creatures or plants will live in the water, or perhaps under it, while non-aquatic creatures have to be handled with more care. Perhaps a non-aquatic species has adapted to life underwater, or lives underwater through magical means (a submerged city encased in a bubble of fresh air). Perhaps the creature lairs

on a semi-permanent structure or land mass above the water: a floating mass of seaweed large enough to support creatures, or a boat, or perhaps the Referee decides to place an actual landmass in the hex in which the lair is generated.

  

➢ A non-aquatic creature is traveling but, when the hex is first entered, is assumed to be in the location where it will be encountered. Once the hex is entered by the adventurers a countdown begins, at the end of which the creature will move on to a different location.

  

➢ The creature lairs nearby and considers the water as part of its territory. It may lair along a riverbank, or

  

atop cliffs overlooking a storm-tossed sea. If this is the case, use whatever terrain type is closest to generate the lair, ignoring any results that could not realistically “travel” to the water-bound. This is especially good for flying creatures, monsters that are amphibious in nature, or humanoids capable of using watercraft.

  

➢ Don’t be afraid to look up! Perhaps the creature lairs in a permanent dwelling above the water: an everpresent waterspout that supports a floating palace, high above the waves, or a cloud city that wanders to and fro over an ocean.

  

Each hex should have a random encounter table that draws its contents from from the hex itself, as well as from the surrounding hexes. On average, a random encounter table should be constructed using a dice range between 1d6 and 1d10, with 1d8 being the average.

  

If using subhexes with the potential for multiple lairs per hex it becomes relatively easy to construct the table, drawing from the immediate hex and the six hexes immediately adjacent to it.

  

If using undivided hexes, which may or may not contain a lair, the Referee may need to draw from hexes further afield to construct the tables.

  

The main question to ask when constructing wandering monster tables is what the range of each monster is. This question can be answered, or at least approximated, using the %-in-lair number. OSE does not include this as part of the monster stat block, but OSRIC (and other systems) do use these numbers (note that OSRIC calls it the “lair probability” number).

  

If using the subhex system the %-in-lair number can be used as follows:

  

➢ If the number is 100% the monster will not be encountered elsewhere in the hex and will only be encountered in their lair. Ex. Crypt things.

  

➢ If the number is between 1 and 99% the range of the creature will be a number of hexes equal to 1 plus the number of times the percentage can be multiplied by 2 before reaching 100.

  

Example 1. Bugbears have a lair probability of 25%. They can be found in their lair hex (25%), the next ring of hexes (50%), and the third ring of hexes (100%), bounded by the black line. See the map, below.

  

Example 2. Goblins have a lair probability of 40%. They can be found in their initial hex (40%) and the first ring (80%) of six hexes immediately surrounding the central hex (bounded by the purple line).

  

Example 3. Grimlocks have a lair probability of 75%. They will only be found in the central hex.

  

If no lair probability is given it means the creature is nomadic and will move on from the indicated hex 1d12 weeks after the adventurers first enter the hex.

  

Giants (humanoids of ogre-size or larger, large dinosaurs, etc.) and flying creatures have their range doubled. Giant flying creatures (such as rocs, dragons, etc.) have their range quadrupled.

  

As a general rule, the greater the range of a creature, the more likely the given monster type is to be found within an adjacent hex – and the greater the chance the creature will be on the wandering encounter table there. Hill giants are more likely to be encountered within one adjacent hex than kobolds, since hill giants have a greater range, so if the Referee has to choose between one of the two to add it makes sense to add the hill giants.

  

As can be seen from those supplied here, there should be plenty of monsters to draw from to populate individual wandering encounter tables.

  

A sample encounter table may look like this:

  

1. Goblins (Broken Fang tribe) 3d6

  

2. Goblins (Shattered Sun tribe) 3d6

  

3. Dire wolves (2d4)

  

4. Stirges (3d10)

  

5. Spider, black widow (1d3)

  

6. Antelope, herd (from adjacent hex) (3d10)

  

7. Giant, hill (from adjacent hex) (1d4)

  

8. Roll on Secondary Table Secondary Table

  

1. Trolls (1d6)

  

2. Orcs (3d4)

  

3. Hobgoblins (3d4)

  

4. NPC party

  

5. Ogres (2d4)

  

6. Wolves (2d6)

  

based upon a large geographic area. If there are three goblin tribes in a mountainous region and one goblin entry on the random encounter table, it will be up to the Referee to decide which tribe – if any – is encountered.

  

The base encounter table includes creatures that are either lairing in the given hex or likely to be encountered in that hex from an adjacent hex. Sometimes a Secondary Table can be included. Encounters on this table may be:

  

➢ Drawn from the surrounding hexes, but are creatures that are less likely to be encountered than those on the primary table.

  

➢ Creatures that do not lair nearby but are drawn from the appropriate terrain tables. These represent traveling monsters that can be encountered in this area.

  

Encounter tables can also include events such as hazards, weather conditions, random magical occurrences, etc. that occur when rolled.

  

Finally, the Referee may decide they don’t want to invest in that much detail, and just create encounter tables

  

When a hex or subhex that contains a lair is entered, the lair probability roll can be used to determine if the creature is currently in its lair. For solitary creatures and small groups there’s a chance that the lair is completely empty. For larger groups – if a humanoid village is encountered, for instance – the lair will rarely be completely empty.

  

Roll the lair probability as normal, and if the result of the roll indicates that the monster is in the lair then all of the inhabitants will be discovered in their lair. If the result indicates they are not in their lair proceed as follows:

  

➢ If the inhabitants are herd animals or monsters that travel in packs (such as wolves, or hellhounds) assume the lair is empty.

  

➢ If there is only a single inhabitant the lair is empty. Note that intelligent monsters rarely leave their lair unguarded for any significant amount of time.

  

➢ If the inhabitants congregate in small numbers or are vermin, bugs, or other unintelligent monsters, roll 1d8. On a result of 1-3 the lair will be empty, otherwise there will be a number of monsters left equal to the roll × 10%.

  

➢ Humans and humanoids will rarely abandon their lair entirely. Roll 1d8; on a result of 1 the lair will be completely empty, otherwise there will be a percentage of monsters remaining equal to the result of the roll × 10%.

  

➢ If the inhabitants are powerful monsters that appear in small numbers (dragon-kin, giant-kin, etc.) roll 1d6. On a result of 1-3 all of the monsters are absent, otherwise only 50% of the number will be absent.

  

The Referee should, of course, use their best judgment when determining if any inhabitants are currently in the lair. If young are present it is unlikely the lair will be completely abandoned.

  

Absent monsters will return as follows; roll 1d6: (1) in 1d4 turns, (2-3) in 1d4 hours, (4-5) in 3d4 hours, (6) in 1d4 days.

  

Example. The party enters a subhex containing a goblin village with 32 inhabitants. Goblins, according to OSRIC, will be found in their lair 40% of the time. The Referee rolls 1d100 and gets an 80; the goblins are not in their lair. However, goblins are intelligent, so she further rolls 1d8, and gets a 4. 40% of the goblins (13) are still in the village.

  

If a lair is eliminated (those dwelling within are slain or driven away) it results in the specific monster entry being removed from the random encounter table. Once a lair is cleared there is a chance – assuming it’s not secured by the adventurers (see p. 22) – of it being repopulated anew. At the end of each month after a lair has been cleared make a wandering monster check using the given chances for the terrain type. If the result is positive for an encounter it means that the lair has been repopulated by a randomly determined monster. Once a lair has been repopulated the monster type is added to the encounter table for that hex.

  

For instance, assume that a hex contains three lairs:

  

1. The Broken Fang goblin tribe

  

2. Dire wolves

  

3. Antelope herd

  

Over a period of two weeks the adventurers succeed in eliminating the goblin tribe and the dire wolf lair. If the adventurers do not patrol the hex the Referee rolls encounter checks for each month the lairs remain unpopulated (unless otherwise stated these checks are made at the end of each

month, starting one full month after the lair has been unoccupied). If the result indicates an encounter, that means a new creature has moved in to occupy the lair.

  

Entering a Subhex with a Lair

  

Whenever the adventurers enter a subhex containing a lair, assume that they automatically become aware of it unless it is hidden or otherwise not immediately visible; if the lair is inside a larger complex it might take some searching to discover. In the rare instance when a lair is hidden or concealed there are several ways its presence can be discovered:

  

➢ Assign a chance for woodswise characters to spot the lair in a manner similar to elves or dwarves spotting secret doors and the like.

  

➢ The adventurers have a chance to discover the presence of the lair’s inhabitants – either by encountering the inhabitants or stumbling across their spoor – and are able to track or follow those back to the lair.

  

The Referee should determine how alert and prepared the inhabitants are.

  

The first question is pretty easy to answer: humans and humanoids that lair in large groups will almost always post guards or have some sort of early detection system, while intelligent creatures that lair in small groups giants, dragons, etc. – will often either have some manner of trap to alert them to the presence of an intruder or will have others stand guard for them. Creatures of less intelligence than, say, goblins, will most often not post guards. If there are guards posted it is a safe assumption that the first encounter will be between the party and the guards, unless suitable precautions are taken.

  

When the lair is encountered make a modified surprise roll for both sides to determine if either is able to detect the presence of the other.

  

➢ If the party has more than ten members add +1 to the monster’s roll.

  

➢ If more than half the party is mounted add +1 to the monster’s roll.

  

➢ If the monster has guards posted add +1 to the roll.

  

➢ If the monster has taken pains to hide their lair subtract –1 from the party’s result.

  

➢ If the adventurers are aware that there is an encounter nearby (they are following tracks, have been alerted by other nearby monsters, seen the spoor the residents create, etc.) add +1 to the party’s roll.

  

➢ If the lair is exceptionally large, such as an entire village of goblins, or a lair of giants, add +1 to the party’s roll.

  

➢ If the “party” consists of one or two advance scouts used to moving through the wilderness stealthily, the monsters suffer a –1 penalty.

  

➢ Do not add Dexterity modifiers to either roll.

  

➢ If the lair’s inhabitants are sensitive to light and the encounter occurs during the day apply a –1 penalty to the inhabitants’ roll. If the encounter occurs at night and the inhabitants can see in the dark subtract –1 from the party’s roll.

  

As with normal surprise rolls a given side is surprised on a result of 1-2. Use the encounter distance by terrain table to determine when a lair is first “seen” (and surprise can first occur). Note that lairs are often much larger – and much more obvious – than a group of monsters, so are often apparent at two or three times the given distances.

  

Creatures that leave their lair will often leave spoor – or signs of their presence – nearby that can alert careful expeditions. Use the same guidelines as described above to determine the creature’s range, but instead of full 6-mile hexes the scale is reduced to subhex size.

  

Goblins have a range of 2 hexes (their own hex and the first ring surrounding it), so their spoor can be found within the subhex containing their lair and the ring of subhexes immediately surrounding it. To use the following hex as an example, if their lair is in subhex 0404, signs of their presence can be detected in subhexes 0404, 0405, 0504, 0503, 0403, 0303, and 0304.

  

Flying creatures, normal predators (such as wolves or great cats), and creatures that are naturally sneaky or leave little

  

sign (such as bugbears, skeletons, etc.) have the range of their spoor reduced by half, to a minimum of 1 subhex.

  

When the adventurers enter a new subhex roll for the party to determine if they spot any existing spoor. The roll is made once, regardless of the individuals in the party, as follows:

  

➢ There’s a base 1-2 in 6 chance of spotting the traces.

  

➢ Increase this chance by 1 if there are any elves or halflings in the party.

  

➢ Increase this chance by 1 if there are any thieves or druids in the party.

  

➢ Increase the chance by 2 if there is a ranger in the party.

  

➢ Decrease the chance by 1 if it is raining.

  

How This All Comes Together

  

When it comes down to actual gaming the order of operations is as follows:

  

1. The adventurers define which areas they’re going to search, and the approximate route they want to take.

  

2. The Referee rolls to determine what the weather will be like. It is recommended that the weather be generated in advance by at least several weeks.

  

3. The Referee determines how long it will take to explore each sub-hex based on terrain type.

  

4. The Referee rolls for random encounters and chances of getting lost.

  

5. If a random encounter occurs determine which subhex it occurs in and what the encounter is with.

  

6. As the adventurers explore each subhex, roll to see if they notice signs of the presence of monsters in nearby subhexes.

  

7. As the adventurers enter each subhex they automatically encounter any features or lairs within the subhex.

  

8. If the adventurers are just traveling through, then only the land immediately surrounding their path is mapped. If they’re exploring within a hex, the hex is considered fully mapped once all of the subhexes have been physically explored. At this point the adventurers learn the number of resources within a hex as well as their approximate value.

  

9. A hex is cleared once the occupants of all lairs within it have been killed, driven off, or reassoned with.



###  Random Weather Generation

When generating hexcrawls – or even adventuring normally – having an idea of the weather can add verisimilitude to the game, if not being a challenge in and of itself. The following rules provide a framework for generating weather conditions for the campaign world. The system is not used to generate temperature: that is left up to the Referee to determine based upon location, climate, and other factors. Referees are encouraged to use their judgment when rolling for weather results; if the result is precipitation, there’s a good chance it’s not going to snow in the summer – unless at high elevations or extreme latitudes – but a much better chance that it will snow in the winter.

When getting ready to run an adventure, or setting up a campaign, it is always a good idea to roll up a month or more of weather. This enables the Referee to work unusual events into the campaign itself. For instance, if the Referee determines that a comet will appear in

the sky during the third week of the adventure, it is possible that certain sages and learned individuals are aware of its arrival, and soothsayers and oracles may have begun to proclaim loudly that its coming signifies some great weal or woe. The unusual weather table at the end of this section exists partly as a means of generating plot hooks.

When rolling for weather the Referee must decide how large an area the resulting weather pattern covers. The first option would be to roll for weather as normal, and assume that each result is “centered” on the party. If the result is for rain, it is raining where the PCs are; if an unusual weather result calls for tornadoes, the assumption is that the tornadoes happen near the PCs’ location.

However, it is typically sufficient to divide the campaign world into geographic regions of approximately 1000 six-mile hexes (roughly 32,000 sq. miles, or an area the size of Maine or South Carolina) or bands of similar


geography. Generally, there will rarely be times when characters travel with such speed that they should be changing climes within minutes, but it is possible that weather or unusual events that occur in one location will not be known in another, even if the two locations are relatively close by.

The intent of these rules is not to accurately model real-world weather conditions but to instead provide a simple way of generating random weather phenomena.

Weather is checked for at the beginning of each day, as follows:


1.  Roll for Clear/Cloudy (Table 7), using 1d20. 
	1. *Subtract 1d4 from rolls in arid climates if desired. 
	2. *Add 1d4 to rolls in wet climates if desired.
	3. A natural “1” or “20” indicates a special event. Refer to the “Unusual Events”, below, for more information.

2.  Roll for Conditions (Tables 8.1 and 8.2), using 1d20.
    
3.  To determine when weather events occur, roll `dice: 1d24`, which indicates the hour (from midnight) when the event begins. A random number generator or online dice roller may be used to generate numbers from 1 to 24; otherwise, the hour can be generated by rolling 1d6 (with a result of 1-3 being a.m. and 4-6 being p.m.) followed by 1d12.
    
4.  Determine amount and intensity of precipitation if it is forecast [[202104290619 Todd Into the Wild#^Precipitation]] .
    
5.  If an Unusual Event (on a natural “1” or “20”) is called for, determine that by rolling 1d100.
    
6.  If desired, roll on Table 10 to determine why an unusual event has occurred.
    
7.  If desired, refer to p. 52 to determine the area affected by weather conditions.

The first roll determines whether the bulk of the day will be clear or overcast. Of course, it is possible to add more granularity, and determine exactly how long any cloud cover lasts. But for purposes of this system, assume the relative cloudiness lasts all day.

It may be desirable to adjust the rolls based on the location/time of year. If the campaign takes place in a locale with weather similar to the Pacific Northwest in winter it would be appropriate to weight the results towards cloudy conditions. If it takes place in a locale with weather similar to southern California, on the other hand, it should be weighted towards clear conditions. The default table, above, assumes an even mix of clear and cloudy conditions.

Once it is determined whether the sky is clear or cloudy a roll is made on the appropriate tables 

(8.1 – Clear or 8.2 – Cloudy) to determine the chance of precipitation. Three sample tables are given for each: arid, temperate and tropical.

If the result is for rain within the next 24 hours, roll 1d24;

the result indicates the hour in which rainfall will begin.

Regardless of the actual chances, once it is determined that there will be rain – either currently falling or at some point during the day – roll on [[202104290619 Todd Into the Wild#^Precipitation]] to determine what the intensity and duration of the rain will be.

^Precipitation


Mild storms are essentially a light drizzle or flurry of precipitation, accumulating perhaps 1/4” of rain per day, at most, or a light dusting of snowfall, accumulating no more than 1” per day. Moderate storms assume a regular, steady rain or snowfall, accumulating perhaps 1/2 to 2 inches of rain or 1d6 inches of snow per day. Violent storms are just that, massive amounts of rain or snow delivered very quickly. Expect a minimum of one inch of rain or 1d2 inches of snow per hour.


#### Game Effects of Weather

The Referee may want to impose penalties due to adverse weather, especially if adventurers are caught outside with no shelter. The previous section discusses some of these already (see Shelter and Weather). Below are some broad examples of game effects that can be applied due to weather, in addition to those already discussed.

#### Rain

➢ For adventurers clad in metal armor, or wielding metal weapons, rust can be a constant problem. While not immediately detrimental, rusty armor might apply a movement or dexterity penalty, as joints move less freely. Likewise, a sword that begins to rust does not suffer immediate mechanical issues, but if ignored it can lead to an increased chance of breakage or even a loss of face when dealing with NPCs; a warrior who cannot keep his blade clean and polished might even be the subject of ridicule.

-   ➢  Bow and crossbow strings are affected by the moisture. On a roll of 1 the string snaps and must be replaced.
    
-   ➢  Moving quickly in the rain can be unpredictable. Whenever a creature attempts to run or charge they must roll their Dexterity or lower on 3d6 (4d6 for extremely heavy rain) or fall.
    
-   ➢  It is also possible that unprotected items – especially those made of paper, such as scrolls or spellbooks – would be ruined by rain.
    

➢ Fire becomes less effective. Non-magical torches, campfires, candles, and other sources are extinguished in heavy rains or burn less fiercely in more moderate rains. Any damage from non- magical fire is rolled twice, taking the lower result. Magical fire is not as affected, but creatures targeted by magical fire suffer 1 less point of damage per die (to a minimum of 1 hp per die, as per a ring of fire resistance).

##### Wind

➢ Firing missile weapons in windy conditions may impose penalties on attack rolls:

o In high winds increase all range bands by one: firing at short range is treated as medium, medium becomes long, and long- range shots are impossible.

o In gale force winds all missile attacks are limited to short range. Roll twice for each attack, taking the worst result.

-   ➢  Small or lightweight items, such as scrolls, material components, etc. may be blown away.
    
-   ➢  If the PCs are in a region with loose soil or sand, high winds could create visibility issues similar to rain. If the winds are really strong, there is even the potential for damage. Unless precautions are taken, an unprotected character might suffer temporary blindness as a result of a dust or sandstorm.


➢ Communication becomes difficult in gale winds and the range that sound carries is reduced by half. Spells that depend on sound may be reduced or dampened.

➢ Movement in gale winds is reduced by 25%. Flying creatures cannot fly in gale-force winds, and have their movement reduced by 50% in strong winds.

##### Lightning

➢ Any time characters are caught outdoors in a thunderstorm there exists the potential for being struck by lightning. When outdoors during a lightning storm there’s a 1 in 100 chance of a lightning strike occurring nearby. On a roll of 1, roll 1d100 again. If the result is 1-5 the strike is close enough to cause damage. Everyone must save versus breath or suffer 6d6 points of damage. On a successful save they take half damage.

##### Snow

-   ➢  Snow raises maintenance issues similar to rain, although with less of a chance of immediate rusting.
    
-   ➢  Accumulated snowfall may reduce movement rates, especially for smaller characters. Assume that every 3” of snow reduces movement by 25%, to a minimum movement of 10’ per round.
    
-   ➢  Extremely heavy snow may collapse roofs/shelters that are not built for such weight.
    
-   ➢  Mechanical effects may result from cold.
    
-   ➢  Characters firing missile weapons suffer the same penalties as in rain.
    
##### Freezing Rain/Sleet/Hail
    

-   ➢  These weather conditions impose modifiers similar to rain.
    
-   ➢  Hail has potential to inflict damage, depending on the size of the stones and ferocity of the storm. The actual mechanical effects can be translated as follows: a mild hailstorm causes no damage to individuals, while a moderate hailstorm inflicts 0-1 hp per turn to unprotected individuals and does not harm those wearing helmets and armor. Severe storms inflict 1-4 hp per turn to unprotected individuals and 0-1 to those wearing helmets and armor.
    
-   ➢  Mechanical effects may result from cold.
    
-   ➢  Hail, sleet, and freezing rain reduce movement by 50%. This movement penalty lasts for as long as ice remains on the ground. Creatures attempting to run must roll their Dexterity or lower on 4d6 to avoid slipping.

In all of the above conditions flight may become difficult, if not impossible. Movement rates may be reduced, or even drop to 0. The larger the creature, the less affected it will be – dragons are bothered less by high winds than griffons, and giant rocs affected less than dragons. If ridden, however, flying mounts may lose smaller riders, even if the larger mounts themselves are not affected.

#### Unusual Results

When a natural “1” or “20” is rolled on Table 7 roll on the table below to determine what unusual weather event occurs. If the result does not fit the region, or setting, roll again. For any entry that lists a chance the condition is magical in nature refer to Table 10 to determine what the supernatural cause is.

The following list of unusual events contains events appropriate for both clear and cloudy days. If an event is appropriate for only one condition it will be indicated as such. Otherwise, assume that events are appropriate

for either and will occur regardless. For instance, if a day is rainy and a meteor shower is called for, it will still happen, but most likely will not be visible.

Roll 1d100 and refer to the proper entry, below:

1-20. Unseasonably hot (approx. 10o hotter). Period of unusual temperature lasts for 1d6 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for double this time.

21-40. Unseasonably cold (approx. 10o colder). Period of unusual temperature lasts of 1d6 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for double this time.

41-45. Unseasonably hot (+11-20o). Period of unusual temperature lasts for 1d4 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance the heat is caused by magical means, and an additional 1 in 6 chance it lasts for double the normal duration. Depending on the season, it may be hot enough that adventurers (especially those wearing heavy armor or engaged in strenuous activity) run the risk of becoming dehydrated. In these cases double the amount of water needed per day (see p. 7).

46-50. Unseasonably cold (–11-20o). Period of unusual temperature lasts for 1d4 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance the cold is caused by magical means, and an additional


1 in 6 chance it lasts for double the normal duration. Depending on the season, the temperature may become cold enough to pose a significant risk to those caught in the elements.

51-55. No winds (becalmed). Lasts for 1d24 hours. There is a 1 in 6 chance this lasts for 1d6+1 days. Unless at sea, or relying upon wind for other reasons, this has no mechanical effects.

56-60. Strong winds. Approx. 20+1d20 mph. The winds last for 1d12 hours. There is a 1 in 6 chance the winds last for double the indicated duration, and a 1 in 6 chance that the winds bring a change in weather (roll again on Table 7, 8 etc.). These winds are considered strong winds. Refer to p. 43 for information on the mechanical effects wind may have.

61-63. Strong winds. Approx. 60+2d20 mph. The winds last for 1d8 hours. There is a 1 in 6 chance the winds last for double the indicated duration, and a 1-3 in 6 chance that the winds bring a change in weather (roll again on Table 7, 8 etc.). The winds are strong enough that light, unsecured objects are blown through the air and weakened or damaged trees/structures are knocked down. These winds are considered gale force. Refer to p. 43 for information on the mechanical effects wind may have.

64-66. Instead of rain, the result is hail. The hail is:

-   ➢  1-3 small
    
-   ➢  4-5 medium
    
-   ➢  6 large
    
    If no rain is forecast when this result is rolled, there is a (1-3) freak storm within 1d24 hours, or (4-6) the hail merely occurs the next time rain is forecast.
    
    67. There is a drastic shift in regional weather patterns. Increase (1-3) or decrease (4-6) the chance of rain by 1d6 in both clear and cloudy conditions. This change in weather will last for:
    

-   ➢  1-2 a week
    
-   ➢  3 a month
    
-   ➢  4 a year
    
-   ➢  5 a decade
    
-   ➢  6 permanently
    
    If the change in weather lasts for a year or more the agricultural output of the region will be altered. The output per hex will be:
   
➢ 1-4 decreased by .5 gp per month
➢ 5-6 increased by .5 gp per month

The Referee rolls the following: 5, 4, 4, 5. He has been using Tables 7 and 8 as given in this document. The results of the rolls indicate that the chance of rainfall in the area is decreased, for approximately a year. It will now only rain on a result of 20 when clear, and 15-20 when cloudy. This seems to agree with the local crops, however, as agricultural output increases by .5 gp per month.

When rolling on Table 11 – Area of Weather add 1d4 to the roll. Additionally, the change in weather adds instability to the region. Any domains within the region have a –1 penalty applied to all morale rolls (see p. 58) made during the period of weather change.

68. The next time precipitation falls it is imbued with random magical qualities. It is:

➢ 1 beneficial to the growth of plants, effectively doubling any yields for the upcoming year (double agricultural output per hex).

➢ 2 detrimental to the growth of plants, effectively halving any yields for the upcoming year (half agricultural output per hex).

➢ 3 leaves a slimy mucus on all surfaces, which lasts for 1d4 hours before evaporating.

➢ 4 evaporates instantly upon falling, leaving all surfaces dry.

➢ 5 rains a weak holy water (1-3) or unholy water (4-6). Treat the substance as half potency for all creatures normally affected by the given substance.

➢ 6 causes non-magical metallic items to rust instantly, reducing their quality by one (metal armor has its AC increased by one, metal weapons inflict one fewer point of damage, etc.).

If using Table 11, subtract 1d6 from the roll.  
69. When determining the area the weather covers, either:

-   ➢  1-3 increase the result by 5.
    
-   ➢  4-6 decrease the result by 5.
    
    See Table 11. Apply this result for the next 1d6 days.
    
    70. Comet in the sky, visible only at night. The comet remains visible for 1d6 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance it is visible for twice as long. The comet:
    

-   ➢  1-3 is just a comet.
    
-   ➢  4 augurs strife and war. Make an automatic Friction roll (see p. 103) for all domains and organizations that can see the comet (on a 1-3 roll for Internal Friction, on 4-6 roll for External Friction).


-   ➢  5 while visible, unusual weather events are more likely, occurring on a roll of 1-2 or 19-20.
    
-   ➢  6 increases tensions and negative emotions. All reaction rolls have a –1 penalty applied, but only while the comet is visible (not during the day or on overcast nights).
    

This comet:

-   ➢  1 is a unique event.
    
-   ➢  2 appears in the sky every 3d4 months.
    
-   ➢  3-5 appears in the sky every 1d10 years.
    
-   ➢  6-11 appears in the sky every 10d10 years.
    
-   ➢  12 appears in the sky every 1d10 centuries.
    
    71. Comet in the sky, visible day and night. The comet remains visible for 1d6 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance it is visible for twice as long. The comet:
    
    -   ➢  1 is just a comet.
        
    -   ➢  2 is an omen that a prominent and ancient family line will end, either by violence (1-2), disease (3- 4), or mishap (5-6).
        
    -   ➢  3 foretells the birth of an important individual, which will happen while the comet is visible. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance the identity of the person will have been foretold by oracles.
        
    -   ➢  4 presages the waking of a potent evil, buried for centuries. Randomly determine the type of creature that awakens.
        
    -   ➢  5 roll 1d6. On a result of 1-4, all damage rolls made – by PC and NPC alike – gain a +1 bonus. On a result of 5-6, damage rolls suffer a –1 penalty. These modifiers last for as long as the comet is visible. Note that if the comet is not visible, either because it is hidden by clouds or the adventurers are underground, for instance, this has no effect. It only occurs when acts of violence are bathed in the comet’s light.
        
    -   ➢  6 Magic acts in an unpredictable manner while the comet is in the sky. Every time an arcane spellcaster casts a spell there is a 1d6% chance that (roll 1d4) 1: the target of the spell is chosen at random, 2: the duration of the spell is either doubled (1-3) or halved (4-6), 3: the range of the spell is either doubled (1-3) or halved (4-6), or 4: the spell functions as if the mage is either 1d4 levels higher (1-3) or 1d4 levels lower (4-6).
        
        This comet:
        

➢ 1 is a unique event



➢ 2 appears in the sky every 3d4 months.  
➢ 3-5 appears in the sky every 1d10 years.  
➢ 6-11 appears in the sky every 10d10 years. ➢ 12 appears in the sky every 1d10 centuries.

72. A star either disappears (1-3) or appears (4-6) in the night sky. This:

➢ 1 signifies the death/birth of a great force for Law (1-3) or Chaos (4-6) on the mortal plane.

➢ 2 marks the death (1-3) or birth (4-6) of a new deity.

➢ 3 weakens (if the star disappears) or strengthens (if a new one appears) the boundaries between the planes. If strengthened, any spell involving the summoning of creatures or travel between the planes now has a 1 in 6 chance of failure; if weakened, add an extra result for extraplanar creatures to all random encounter tables, and creatures summoned during this time gain 1 hp per HD.

➢ 4 inexplicably affects the turning of undead. If a star disappears, apply a –1 penalty to all turn attempts; if a star appears, apply a +1 bonus.

➢ 5 signifies the onset of a period of either the reduction (if the star vanishes) or increase (if a star appears) in the activities of a specific type of monster (such as undead, lycanthropes, dragons, etc). The Referee should interpret how this affects the campaign world and gameplay.

➢ 6 is a natural occurrence and means nothing. The stellar occurrence lasts:

➢ 1-2 1d6 days.  
➢ 3-4 1d6 weeks.  
➢ 5-6 1d12 months. ➢ 7 1d10 years.  
➢ 8 permanently.

73. Meteor shower. Visible (1-5) at night or (6) during the day as well. The shower lasts for 1d4 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance of it lasting for twice the rolled duration. The shower:

-   ➢  1 causes the recently dead (within the past year) to rise from the grave and attack the living as zombies, and those killed by the zombies will in turn rise from the dead in 1d4 hours.
    
-   ➢  2 brings a strange space plague that infects an area determined by Table 11. Roll on Table 3, adding 10 to the results in each column.


-   ➢  3 rains fiery death down upon a region. Everything within the area of the strike takes 3d6 points of damage, and there is a 1-4 in 6 chance the meteors start wildfires. The meteor shower reduces economic output of the area affected by 1d6×5% for 1d4 months.
    
-   ➢  4 are actually space monsters, falling to earth in a cocoon of stone. There is a 1-2 in 6 chance they come in peace.
    
-   ➢  5-6 contains extremely valuable ore, worth 1d4×100 gold coins per 8 oz. recovered. The starmetal can be used as a principal or special component to create magical items. Randomly determine what properties starmetal imbues when used for weaponry. In Absalom, for instance, starmetal – born of the void of space – is potent against elementals.
    

This shower:

-   ➢  1-3 is a unique event.
    
-   ➢  4 appears in the sky every 3d4 months.
    
-   ➢  5-6 appears in the sky every 1d10 years.
    
-   ➢  7-9 appears in the sky every 10d10 years.
    
-   ➢  10-12 appears in the sky every 1d10 centuries.
    
    The meteor shower is composed of 1d100 meteors. Each meteor has a 1% chance of reaching the ground. Each meteor that reaches the ground weighs
    
    -   ➢  1 1d8 oz.
        
    -   ➢  2-3 4d4 oz.
        
    -   ➢  4-5 1d4 pounds.
        
    -   ➢  6 2d20 pounds.
        
        74. Meteor shower. This is just a mundane meteor shower, albeit one presenting an opportunity for profit. It is composed of 1d100 shooting stars; each meteor has a flat 1% chance of landing on the ground. Each meteor that reaches the ground weighs
        
    
    -   ➢  1 1d8 oz.
        
    -   ➢  2-3 4d4 oz.
        
    -   ➢  4-5 1d4 pounds.
        
    -   ➢  6 2d20 pounds.
        
        Every 8 ounces recovered are worth 1d4×100 gp. See above (#73) for the uses of starmetal.
        
        75. Forest/wildfire. The fire will burn for 1d6 days if no attempt is made to stop it. For each day it burns the fire will destroy 3d10 square miles. Light rain has


a 25% chance of extinguishing the fire per day of rain, moderate rain has a 25% chance per four hours of rain, and heavy rain has a 25% chance per hour.

76. The sky turns an unusual color for 1d12 hours. There is a 1 in 6 chance this change lasts for double the given duration. This

-   ➢  1-2 augurs ill for all who can observe the color. Any rolls of natural 20 made during this effect become natural 1s.
    
-   ➢  3-4 causes mass confusion among wildlife. Animals lose their fear of Man and try to flee, becoming easier to hunt during this period.
    
-   ➢  5-6 babies born during this time bear marks that resemble the changed color: their eyes, hair, or birthmarks are of the same strange color.
    
    77. Solar eclipse (partial). The sun is partially obscured for a period of 1d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance the eclipse lasts for twice as long as the indicated duration. During this time
    

-   ➢  1 barriers between the worlds are lessened. Summoning spells function at twice their normal efficacy.
    
-   ➢  2 undead grow more powerful. All undead, regardless of whether they can see the eclipse or not, gain an extra hit die during this period.
    
-   ➢  3 no clerical spells of fourth level or higher may be cast.
    
-   ➢  4 magic is either enhanced (1-3) or hampered (4- 6), with all arcane spellcasters casting spells as if they were one level higher or lower while the sun is eclipsed.
    
-   ➢  5-6 it is just a solar eclipse. Try not to stare directly at it.
    
    There is a –5 penalty to the roll on Table 11 when determining the area affected.
    
    78. Solar eclipse (total). The sun is totally obscured for a period of 1d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for twice as long as the given duration. During this time
    

-   ➢  1 non-magical fires sputter and go out. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance that they re-light by themselves once the eclipse ends.
    
-   ➢  2 the barriers between worlds totally collapse. Summoning spells function at four times their normal efficacy, and 1d10–1 uncontrolled extraplanar creatures manage to enter the world.
    

➢ 3 the undead are free to walk abroad. Any undead


bound to a specific area within the effect of the eclipse are free to move about during the eclipse, but must swiftly return to their lairs once it is over. In addition, all undead gain an additional 2 hit dice.

➢ 4 all saving throws either gain a +1 bonus (1-3) or a –1 penalty (4-6).

➢ 5-6 it is just a solar eclipse.  
Apply a –5 penalty when rolling on Table 11 to

determine the area of effect.

79. Lunar eclipse. Lunar eclipses occur only during the full moon and can typically be seen over a fairly large area (an entire continent, perhaps). If using Table 11, add 3 to the roll. The eclipse lasts for 4d20 minutes. If the Referee has already established a lunar calendar, assume this result occurs during the next full moon. If not, assume the lunar eclipse happens on the day this result is rolled; further full moons can be extrapolated from this result. Unlike solar eclipses, when the earth fully obscures the sun, the moon merely takes on a red to brown tint and is often referred to as a blood moon. During the full 24 hours on the day a lunar eclipse occurs:

-   ➢  1 wounds do not heal. Any damage taken during the eclipse will not heal by natural means. Either magic or specially prepared poultices must be used to facilitate healing.
    
-   ➢  2 lycanthropic activity is especially pronounced. Add or increase the chances of encountering lycanthropes on the appropriate encounter tables. In the period during the blood moon, lycanthropes gain an additional hit die, and the risk of contracting the disease is doubled if bitten.
    
-   ➢  3 it is a time for communing with spirits. Any spell or ability that allows one to ask questions or consult spirit or extraplanar beings grants an additional question (1-3) or an increased chance of getting correct answers (4-6).
    
-   ➢  4-6 it is just a lunar eclipse.
    
    80. Earthquake. Apply a –7 modifier to Table 11 when determining the area affected. Roll 1d12 to determine the severity of the quake:
    

-   ➢  1-3 mild tremors. The ground shakes slightly, but not quite strongly enough to knock paintings off of walls.
    
-   ➢  4-6 minor tremors. The ground shakes with enough force to rattle plates on shelves and knock poorly hung paintings off walls. No damage to


buildings, unless they’re poorly built.

-   ➢  7-8 strong tremors. Objects will likely fall, buildings sustain minor damage (1d3 points of structural damage*). At the epicenter of the quake, a small rift in the earth may open.
    
-   ➢  9-10 Major tremors. Objects are knocked from shelves, buildings take structural damage* (1d6 points). A large rift in the earth may open up at the epicenter of the quake. Standing adventurers must make a Dexterity check rolling 3d6 to avoid being knocked off their feet.
    
-   ➢  11. Severe tremor. Buildings suffer significant structural damage* (3d6 points). There is a 1-3 in 6 chance of fires starting in densely inhabited areas. Standing adventurers must make a Dexterity check rolling 4d6 to avoid being knocked off their feet. Streams and small rivers may have their courses shifted, and a large rift may open near the epicenter.
    
-   ➢  12. Once-in-a-lifetime quake. Buildings suffer massive damage (6d6 points of structural damage*). There is a 1-4 in 6 chance of fires starting in densely inhabited areas. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance that major rivers shift course by 1d6 miles. Standing adventurers must make a Dexterity check rolling 5d6 to avoid being knocked over.
    
    *See Structural Considerations, p. 66, for structural hit points.
    
    e earthquake lasts for 1d12 rounds and does the ollowing:
    
    ➢ 1-2 nothing outside of being an earthquake.  
    ➢ 3 releases some ancient evil or imprisoned
    
    monster.
    
    ➢ 4 reveals a long-lost tomb or ruin.
    
    ➢ 5 reveals a portal to the Elemental Plane of Earth. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance the portal is not permanent and will close 2d10 hours after the quake.
    
    ➢ 6 uncovers a previously undiscovered vein of valuable ore or minerals, capable of producing 1d100 × 1000 gold coins worth of ore.
    
    nfrastructure in the area (such as roads, dams, bridges) uffers damage equal to 1d12 × 100 gp × the severity f the quake, while urban centers take damage equal o 1d20 × 100 gp × Market Class × the severity of the uake as follows:
    
    ➢ Mild and normal tremors do no damage to

infrastructure.

-   ➢  Strong tremors have a gp damage multiplier of 1.
    
-   ➢  Major tremors have a gp damage multiplier of 1.25.
    
-   ➢  Severe tremors have a gp damage multiplier of 1.5.
    
-   ➢  Once-in-a-lifetime tremors have a gp damage multiplier of 2.
    
    Refer to the chapter on Domain Building for more information on infrastructure. If specific investments have been chosen assign damage as makes the most sense or roll to randomly assign damage. If using abstract investment costs simply subtract the damage from the total investment amount.
    
    81. The prevailing winds shift direction for 1d24 hours, bringing:
    

-   ➢  1 a smell of jasmine or other exotic spice.
    
-   ➢  2 the smell of the ocean, even if there is not one
    
    nearby.
    
-   ➢  3 the charnel smell of a slaughter-house.
    
-   ➢  4 a light dusting of ash, as if from a fire.
    
-   ➢  5 whispering voices, speaking in unknown tongues.
    
-   ➢  6-8 nothing. If using Table 11, subtract 5 from the roll.
    
    82. An unusual rain, with no clouds in sight. The “rain” consists of:
    

-   ➢  1 frogs.
    
-   ➢  2 snakes.
    
-   ➢  3 locusts.
    
-   ➢  4 blood.
    
-   ➢  5fish.
    
-   ➢  6 flowers.
    
    If using Table 11, subtract 10 from the roll. Roll on Table 9 to determine the length/severity of the “rain”. In heavy “rains” those unprotected may suffer damage or other impediments.
    
    83. Heavy rains inundate the area, lasting 3d4 minutes and dropping a quarter inch of rain per minute. Flash floods are a danger in ravines, creek beds, and low-lying areas. If using Table 11, subtract 5 from the roll.
    
    84. Strong winds whip through the region, creating miniature dust devils. There is a 1 in 6 chance that dust devils are actually small air elementals. If using Table 11, subtract 10 from the roll. The strong winds last for



3d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance the dust devils last for double the indicated duration.

85. The localized weather system spawns tornadoes. The storm lasts for 4d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance the tornadoes last for double the indicated duration. The storm spawns 1d12 tornadoes, with a 1 in 6 chance that twice as many are created. If using Table 11, subtract 7 from the roll. The tornadoes

➢ 1-3 are just tornadoes.  
➢ 4 are in fact rampaging air elementals, who will

attack all living creatures they come across.

➢ 5 conceal a portal to another plane. There is a 1-4 in 6 chance the portal leads to the Elemental Plane of Air. Those sucked into the tornado are immediately transported there. The portal disappears when the tornadoes end.

➢ 6 cause no physical damage, but instead suck up all the color from the region. There is a 1 in 6 chance this effect is permanent, otherwise color returns in 1d12 hours.

86. The clouds form recognizable shapes that last for

-   ➢  1-2 a few minutes.
    
-   ➢  3-4 a few hours.
    
-   ➢  5-6 all day.
    
    The shapes
    

-   ➢  1 resemble specific individuals or creatures.
    
-   ➢  2 scenes from history.
    
-   ➢  3 events that may occur in the future.
    
-   ➢  4 words or runes in a known language.
    
-   ➢  5 words or runes in an unknown language.
    
-   ➢  6 the PCs themselves.
    
    87. The clouds are an unusual color. They retain this color for:
    
    ➢ 1-2 a few minutes. ➢ 3-4 a few hours.  
    ➢ 5-6 all day.
    
    88. A city can plainly be seen atop a cloud. This city is:
    

-   ➢  1-2 inhabited.
    
-   ➢  3-4 abandoned (note that this result implies it has been abandoned by its builders. The cloud city may yet be inhabited by monsters).
    
-   ➢  5-6 an illusion. The city is:


➢ 1-2 composed of cloud-stuff.

-   ➢  3-4 made of stone and earth.
    
-   ➢  5-6 spun from magic itself.
    
    The city will be inhabited by
    

-   ➢  1 cloud giants.
    
-   ➢  2 winged bird-men.
    
    ➢ 3 a race of men that has sworn never to touch solid ground.
    
    ➢ 4-6 a randomly determined type of creature, regardless of their ability to fly.
    
    There is a 1 in 6 chance the city will last for only 1d6 days before disappearing.
    
    89. Unnatural events. Apply a –3 penalty if using Table 11. For the next 1d6 days, strange things occur that violate the laws of nature. There is a 1 in 6 chance these events last for twice the indicated duration. There will be:
    

➢ 1-3 One type of occurrence.  
➢ 4-5 Two types of occurrence, each with a similar

duration.

➢ 6 Three types of occurrence, each with a similar duration.

Sample unnatural events are as follows:

1.  Birds are observed flying backwards through the skies.
    
2.  The roles of prey and predator are reversed: the lamb hunts the lion, the worm the bird.
    
3.  Rain can be seen falling up.
    
4.  When rain falls it is strangely colored. 1. blue, 2. green, 3. red, 4. orange, 5. black, 6. gray. There is a 1 in 6 chance the rain will actually change the color of the landscape.
    
5.  Water does not boil.
    
6.  Fires burn but do not give off heat.
    
7.  Animals begin speaking with human voices.
    
8.  When oracles sacrifice an animal to read its entrails, they find 1-2 it has no innards; 3-4 a message, in the Common tongue, telling them exactly where to put their prophesies; or 5-6 writhing masses of maggots.
    
9.  Domesticated animals birth unnatural, deformed monstrosities.
    

10. Uneducated peasants all of a sudden begin to


grasp complicated philosophical arguments and leave their tasks to debate these new ideas.

There is a 1-3 in 6 chance the unnatural events portend some terrible disaster (1-4) or propitious boon (5-6). Otherwise, some weird stuff just happens. Regardless, all areas affected immediately make an Internal Friction roll.

90. A rainbow is visible in the sky without rain. The rainbow is:

-   ➢  1-3 a single.
    
-   ➢  4-5 a double.
    
-   ➢  6 a triple.
    
    The rainbow lasts for 1d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for twice the given duration, and another 1 in 6 chance its rainbow stripes are arranged in a different order than would normally be expected. In addition:
    
    ➢ 1-3 it’s just a rainbow.
    
    ➢ 4 there is a 1 in 6 chance every five minutes the rainbow is present that a leprechaun approaches the party, offering the adventurers directions to its pot of gold in exchange for some fey bargain.
    
    ➢ 5 the rainbow is a bridge to another world, and will transport any who step aboard to this other realm. There is a 1-2 in 6 chance the bridge is guarded.
    
    ➢ 6 the rainbow is an omen sent by the gods, to guide the adventurers to their destiny. This may be (1-3) something they actually seek or (4-6) a person, item, or place as yet unknown to them.
    
    91. Aurora. Strange bands of light appear in the night sky, dancing as if alive. The aurora typically lasts for 3d20 minutes, although there is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for double the indicated duration. Typically, the aurora is only seen far north or south of the equator, although this need not be the case in a fantasy world. The aurora
    

-   ➢  1 is a sentient creature, possibly an elemental.
    
-   ➢  2 produces barely audible music.
    
    ➢ 3 acts as a gateway to other worlds. One must be able to fly into the shimmering lights in order to travel by these means.
    
    ➢ 4 causes all spells cast under its light to have all their variable effects occur at their maximum limits.
    
    ➢ 5-6 is just pretty lights in the sky.  
    92. Corpse-lights (“St. Elmo’s Fire”). Typically, this
    

strange form of static lightning is harmless. It tends


to coalesce on pointed objects, such as masts, prows, spires of towers, etc., although there are reports of people’s fingers and noses being outlined in this strange, flickering light. If using Table 11, subtract 10 from the roll. It lasts for 1d20 hours, with a 1 in 6 chance of lasting double the given duration. This strange weather event most often occurs with precipitation – or foggy conditions – so the Referee might want to wait and apply it the next time there is rain/snow. In addition to spooking the ignorant and superstitious, the corpse-light:

-   ➢  1-4 is simply a natural phenomenon.
    
-   ➢  5 is actually a sentient being, attempting to communicate in a language based on the subtle flickering of light.
    
-   ➢  6 increases the chance of encounters with undead whilst the fire lasts. Add 1d4 types of undead to the applicable encounter tables.
    
    93. A dense fog covers the land. The fog lasts for 1d20 hours and has a 1 in 6 chance of lasting twice as long as indicated. Any folk trying to navigate in the fog run the risk of becoming lost, based on whatever rules the Referee is using for navigating in the wilderness. Double the chances of getting lost while in the fog. The fog:
    

-   ➢  1-2 is just normal fog, reducing vision by three- quarters.
    
-   ➢  3 contains monsters not native to this region.
    
-   ➢  4 is semi-solid, reducing movement rates by half.
    
-   ➢  5 leads to another world or plane. Any persons becoming lost in the fog have a 1 in 6 chance of entering this other world for every hour spent wandering.
    
-   ➢  6 causes any humans or demi-humans that die within the fog to automatically rise as undead unless cremated within an hour of death. If using Table 11, subtract 5 from the roll.
    
    94. A thin mist covers the land. The mist lasts for 1d12 hours, with a 1 in 6 chance of lasting twice as long as indicated. The mist
    

-   ➢  1-3 is just normal mist.
    
-   ➢  4 contains life-draining mist monsters.
    
-   ➢  5 smells of sulfur.
    
-   ➢  6 forces those casting any sort of spell while


physically within the mist to succeed on a Save v. Spells in order to actually do so. If using Table 11, subtract 5 from the roll.

95. Ball lightning. Literal balls of lightning float about, doing as much damage as an actual bolt of lightning. A typical storm will generate 1d10 balls of lightning within the given area. These balls are slow, moving at only 20’ per round, but just as dangerous as normal lightning, especially since they can remain in contact with a target for multiple rounds. Ball lightning is attracted to:

➢ 1 large amounts of metal.

➢ 2 tall buildings.

➢ 3 strong magical dweomers.

➢ 4 creatures of Chaos.

➢ 5 creatures of Law.

➢ 6 indiscriminate targets. If using Table 11 subtract 10 from the roll.

96. Extended weather system. The weather indicated by the day’s roll lasts an addition 1d4 days.

97. Changeable weather. Halfway through the day, the weather has a chance of abruptly changing. Roll again on Table 7, etc.

98. Magical drought (1-3) or surfeit (4-6). For 1d24 hours, all arcane (1-3), divine (4-6) or both (7-8) spells require a successful Save v. Spells to cast successfully (drought), or are cast as if the caster were 1d4 (determine randomly for each spell) levels higher (surfeit).

99-100. These two results are left blank for the Referee to fill in with their own custom events, or to duplicate events from elsewhere on the table so as to increase their chances of occurrence. For instance, in an area known for seismic activity, they may wish to fill both 99 and 100 with additional earthquake (#80) entries.

If desired, the Referee may roll on Table 10 to determine the exact cause of any unusual weather.

If desired, the Referee can roll on Table 11 to determine the area each weather effect – whether normal or unusual – covers. This may be useful at higher levels when travel becomes faster due to flight, teleportation, etc.

Note that some of the results on Table 11 are only possible by rolling for an Unusual Event that specifies it.

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-4        | No reason. Stuff like this just happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5-6        | These events occur on a regular or semi-regular basis. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance such occurrences can be predicted, otherwise they happen at random but semi-regular intervals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7          | Planar boundaries between the normal world and an elemental plane have weakened, resulting in an increase in unusual weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 8-9        | It is the result of a malicious spell. Some being has cast a spell to wreak havoc upon the land. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance that, regardless of the duration given in the event description, it will not end until the miscreant is brought to justice.It is possible this result does not make sense with the event. In such cases, roll again on this table, or chose a more appropriate result. |
| 10-11      | It is the result of a beneficial spell. It is possible this result does not make sense with the event. In such cases, roll again on this table, or chose a more appropriate result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12-13      | A druid or other guardian of nature has precipitated the event in order to achieve balance. Perhaps humanity has been getting to numerous, and a change in weather patterns will result in smaller crop yields.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 14-15      | It is an unintentional side-effect of some powerful spell. There is a 1-4 in 6 chance the anomaly is a one-time event, but otherwise the events will happen with increasing frequency as the wizard or coven in question continues to cast the offending spell.                                                                                                                                    |
| 16-17      | Some god or mighty being has decided to visit the event upon the people as punishment (or, when a beneficial event occurs, as a boon). There is a 1-2 in 6 chance the event will continue until the god’s anger has been sated.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 18         | The event is part of a prophecy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 19         | The event is foretold as an omen that signifies something (the birth of a dreadful monster, the death of a hero, the end of the Age of Heroes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 20         | It is caused by a powerful artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
