**Setting an Ambush**
An ambush encounter offers a fantastic answer to spicing up combat. They are also easy to slot into a travel session as the party explores any landscape ripe with cover.
**Ambushes - Forcing the Party to Play From Behind**
An ambush is a unique type of encounter in that it forces one side to be fighting at a significant disadvantage.
The ambushers have already set up the battlefield. They’ve chosen the perfect location and are waiting in an ideal position. They have a tactical advantage.
Ambushers benefit from the Hiding, Unseen Attacker, and Surprise mechanics. These mechanics give ambushers offensive and defensive boons.
These advantages force the party to overcome hurdles to defeat their ambushers. Oftentimes this disparity results in the party expending valuable resources.
**The Mechanics of an Ambush**
Let’s go over the rules for the Hiding, Unseen Attacker, and Surprise mechanics.
**Hiding:**

*   Use their passive Perception if they aren’t actively searching
*   Call for a Perception check if they are actively searching
*   Invisible creatures can always attempt to hide
*   You give your position away if you make noise
*   A hidden creature gains the Unseen Attacker status

The complete Hiding rules are on page 177 of the PHB.
**Unseen Attacker:**

*   Creatures attacking YOU have disadvantage on attack rolls.
*   You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that cannot see you.
*   You give your position away once you make an attack.
*   You are no longer Hiding nor are you an Unseen Attacker.

The complete Unseen Attacker rules are on page 194-195 of the PHB.
The DM determines **Surprise** before rolling initiative. If one side is Hiding, the DM compares their **Stealth** checks to the **passive Perception** of each opposing creature.
Anyone who doesn’t notice the threat is **Surprised** at the beginning of the encounter.
A **Surprised** creature or character cannot do the following during their first turn:

*   Move
*   Take any Action (Including Bonus Actions)
*   Take a Reaction until the end of their turn

Keep in mind that a member of the group can be Surprised even if their allies are not.
The complete Surprise rules are on page 189 of the PHB.
An ambush in 5e uses the combination of all three of these mechanics. Thus it’s important to have an understanding of all three before running an ambush encounter.
**Setting Up the Ambush**
Preparing an ambush is like preparing any other encounter. You still need to choose creatures to use and position them.
Positioning for an ambush requires extra consideration. Ambushers should be close enough to the party to attack. Yet far enough to still be hiding.
**Choose Your Location**
The location is the foundation of a successful ambush. An ideal location includes plenty of cover for foes to hide behind.
A location that gives ambushers tactical advantages over the party is preferable. For instance, a location with high ground or patches of difficult terrain.
**Select Your Creatures**
Choose creatures that synergize with each other, such as ones that bridge gaps in each others’ stat blocks in an ambush encounter.
Choose creatures that excel at hiding. This could mean they have proficiency in **Stealth.** However, that’s not your only option. For example, the creature could also cast **Invisibility** or have a form of camouflage as a trait.
The better your creatures are at hiding, the more likely they’ll gain the Surprise Round.
**Pre-Encounter Positioning**
Positioning is crucial when setting an ambush.
Creatures must be far enough away to get a **Surprise Round.** Yet close enough to attack in case the party isn't **Surprised.**
Melee ambushers should hide close to the point of the ambush, allowing them to rush in and attack during the **Surprise Round.**
You could also use unhidden melee units as bait to lure the party into the ambush.
Ranged ambushers should be as far away as possible while still hiding behind **cover.** They should also spread-out to avoid having AoE spells and effects.
**Traps**
An ambush is a premeditated encounter. Meaning your creatures will have time to set up some traps around the battlefield if they wish to.
For example, you could place a pitfall in the middle of the road. This could entrap some of the party before the fight even begins.
You could even use slime or mud to create difficult terrain around your ranged attackers, slowing the party’s advance and giving your ranged units time to reposition.
**Playing Out the Ambush**
While the **Surprise Round** is only a single round of combat, it’s the most important round of an ambush.
Try to deal as much damage as possible during the surprise round. Make use of your ambushers' **Unseen Attacker** perks.
Focus on taking one of the party members out via damage or crowd control. This lowers the party's damage output before they can act, increasing your units' survivability.
Make use of the **Surprised** creatures’ inability to use their **Reaction.** Reposition your units around the battlefield without worrying about **Opportunity Attacks.**
You could also use your **Surprise Round** to set up for your creatures’ MVP Ability. Such as:

*   Crowd-control the party
*   Shove or grapple characters into position
*   Debuff the party or buff allies

Use this extra time well and you’ll set your creatures up for success for the rest of the encounter.
**Countering an Ambush**
There are many ways to prevent or avoid being **Surprised.**
A high **passive Perception** is the simplest counter. A perceptive character can oftentimes avoid ambushes, allowing them to act while the rest of their comrades cannot.
The party could also scout ahead, making active **Perception** checks. For instance, they could use a flying familiar to keep watch high above the treetops.
There are also feats and features that can counter ambushes.
For instance, the **Alert** feat ( PHB pg 165) prevents:

*   being surprised while conscious
*   **Unseen Attackers** attacking the character at advantage

The Barbarian’s **Feral Instinct** (PHB pg 49) is another example. It allows the barbarian to enter a rage to act during a surprise round if they’re conscious.
Remember, **Surprise** functions on an individual basis. One member of the party seeing through your ambush doesn’t mean the entire party noticed it.
**Creating a Fallback Plan**
It’s important to consider what your creatures might do if some or all of the party is not Surprised by their ambush.
Depending on your creatures’ goals, they may choose to:

*   Continue fighting no matter what
*   Retreat using the **Dash** and **Disengage** actions
*   Lure the party into the next group of enemies
*   Surrender

A failed ambush is why initial positioning is so important. Proper positioning gives your creatures a fighting chance against the party. Even without the mechanical perks of an ambush.

A disguised [Bandit Captain](https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/monsters/bandit_captain/) is pretending to be a traveling merchant whose cart is stuck in a ditch.
Their job is to lure the party into the center of the map. If they succeed, the rest of the [Bandits](https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/monsters/bandit/) will pop out and shoot their crossbows at the party.
**The Calm Before the Storm**
Ambushes give one side noticeable mechanical and tactical advantages.
They're also great encounters to throw into a travel session. You can even use ambushes to reveal new enemies or threats to the party as they travel through new lands.
The increased threat of ambushes often drains extra resources from the party, softening them up before the adventure even begins.
