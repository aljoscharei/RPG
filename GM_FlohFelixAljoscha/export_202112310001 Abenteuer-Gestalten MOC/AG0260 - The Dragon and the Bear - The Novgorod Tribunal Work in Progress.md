[[AG0260 - The Dragon and the Bear - The Novgorod Tribunal.pdf]]
[[Ars Magica MOC]]


Welcome to the Novgorod tribunal! The Dragon and the Bear is a supplement to Ars Magica Fourth Edition, providing detailed background on the lands of Poland, Russia, and beyond. This background includes a terrific variety of national, religious, magical, dynastic, and Hermetic struggles that will provide the raw stuff of epic conflict upon which a good saga thrives.

The Novgorod Tribunal is the Hermetic geographic designation of a vast swathe of eastern Mythic Europe. There are a dozen principalities within this area: Novgorod itself, Suzdalia, Smolensk, Polotsk, Volinia, Kiev, Chernigov, Ryazan, Pereyaslavl, Galicia, and Pinsk-Turov, as well as the Kingdom of Poland (see the tribunal map at the end of the book).

Despite the great size of this territory, the tribunal is numerically weak, with only six covenants. It is also young, with a history little more than two centuries old. Furthermore, it has the misfortune to be situated in a land that is riven by more conflicts than any other in Christendom. Whatever issue can be fought about, will be fought about, be it tribal, social, religious, dynastic, diplomatic, or military. All too often the tribunal of Novgorod has found itself squarely in the middle of things and scrambling to preserve, if not its independence, then at least its survival.

The theme of most Novgorodian sagas will, thus, be conflict. Peace is fleeting, conflict eternal, and though the land is rich and full of opportunity, such opportunities are only bought at the price of bitter compromise.

What then, are these conflicts?

Always there has been the ebb and flow of nomad invasions, bursting out of Asia, sweeping over the south Russian plains, and thundering into Europe. Throughout the








middle ages these assaults were continual: first the Huns, then the Avars, the Khazars, the Magyars, and the Patzinak Turks. By the early 13th century a nomadic tribe called the Cumans dominates the south Russian steppe, raiding ruthlessly around Kiev, Chernigov, and Pereyaslavl.

Then there are the native people of this land, the Slavs, whose tradition of religion and magic is over two thousand years old. Two hundred years ago they suffered forced Christian conversion at the hands of their monarchs. These early kings were not weak men, but they were intent upon alignment with the great powers of their time, Byzantium and the Holy Roman Empire, the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Pope of Rome. The native priest/magicians resisted vigorously and there are still many secret gatherings of pagan worshippers.

There are the Old Gods of the Slavs, who are suffering a slow and bitter decline. Their

battle is grim, angry, and ultimately futile but nonetheless passionate. Around these Old Ones a host of faeries has mustered — the spirits of sky, land, and water — contending against a seemingly relentless fall into the Christian night.

There has been political and dynastic conflict of mighty fathers foolishly rearing broods of bickering sons. Every crack in the solidarity of the Russian and Polish royal houses has been endlessly explored, bringing about envy and family rancor, military adventurers and land-hungry younger brothers, nomadic raids and foreign wars.

And, in time, there will be the Mongols, the last of the nomadic conquerors and the worst. Inspired by the towering genius of Genghis Khan, they will fight for total world domination, carrying their vision forward through three blazing generations of relentless conquest before dynastic conflict brings them down. Their thrust against Europe will shatter the Slavs, crush Russia beneath a foreign yoke for two hundred years, and raid prosperous Poland into a burning wasteland.

In all of this, the Order of Hermes is a small factor: a few score secretive practitioners virtually lost in a sea of strife. Their entry into Russia and Poland was only possible after the Christian conversion, and their tenure has been rocked by internal dissension and external pressures. Soon, it seems, matters will grow tragically worse, for as the 13th century begins two great traditions within the House of Bjornaer come clamoring viciously to the surface. On one side, the Wilderists demand the right to defend land and animals against mundanes. On the other the Harmonists preach a radical integration.

Misconceptions

What popular notions of Russian and Polish culture do we need to discard?

Forget about St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Warsaw. None of these cities is of any significance in our period.

Throw out ideas about the Cossacks, they don’t come along until the 15th century.

Reject all images of cities, fortresses, and palaces made of stone. From peasant’s cot to city wall to royal road, everything, bar, at a relatively late date, the senior cathedrals and great city gates, was built of ornately-carved, beautifully-worked wood.

Think of small rural communities of thirty, forty, or fifty people; this is the Zadrugya, the “great family.” Fathers and mothers, groups of brothers with their families, or collections of close cousins, banded together to work the land. In the original Slavic culture, groups of Zadrugya made up a clan. Groups of clans made up loose-knit tribes. This was the base upon which the Slavic princedoms were built.

Think of trade; think of rivers. From the Baltic one can travel south along the Dvina, Nieman, Oder, Vistula, Velkat, and Volkhov, from the Volkhov to the Volga, from the Nieman to the Dnieper and from these two rivers, and via a host of tributaries, to the Black sea and Caspian. For centuries before the Vikings descended on the Slavs to hammer together the first Russian kingdom, trade swam along a fifteen-hundred mile network of rivers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_from_the_Varangians_to_the_Greeks

And trade made cities. Though the Novgorod tribunal encompasses a mighty wilderness, the rivers have grown great cities: Novgorod in the north, city of merchants by the shore of lake Ilmen; Kiev in the south, “the Mother of Russian cities” on its hills above the Dnieper; and Vladimir, capital of Suzdalia, its glory great but its reign brief.




Geography and Climate

Russia is divided latitudinally into a series of climatic zones.

In the most extreme north there are small fringes of arctic waste.

South of the arctic waste lies a broad belt of taiga. This includes the great bulk of Siberia and sweeps just far enough south and west to clip the edge of the gulf of Finland. The taiga is harsh and windswept, modestly forested with conifers and populated by the hardiest animals and people. The taiga enjoys a brief spring and summer, during which growth is explosive and the local populations boom.

To the south of the taiga is the great forest belt, a dense mixture of conifers and deciduous woodlands. These are the primeval forests of Europe. The forest forms a solid bulwark sweeping east from the Baltic to the Urals, and from as far north as the Baltic and Finnish coasts, down to the environs of Kiev and the Carpathians. All of Poland is in the forest belt. Settlement within the forest concentrates along the rivers which form natural highways. The animal population of the forests is rich with deer, boar, bear, moose, aurochs, and wolf.

South of the forests is a mixed zone, the forest-steppe, a band of plain and pasture interspersed with substantial wooded valleys. Kiev lies on the northern edge of this zone.


South of the forest-steppe lies the true steppe. This is the nomad road from the east, plain and pasture stretching from the Carpathian mountains for thousands of miles, through Mongolia and on to the Pacific coast. The steppe begins about eighty miles south of Kiev and runs due south until it reaches the Black sea. It is characterized by extraordinarily rich black soil.

General Climatic Conditions

There is no significant geographical barrier between Siberia, with its arctic influences, and European Russia. The Ural mountains are the only real highland, and they are old and worn. They are not high enough to block the frigid northern winds that sweep south and west in the fall. In consequence, Russian and Polish winters are very harsh.

In the arctic waste winter never relents.

In the taiga wintry conditions persist for six months of the year. Spring and summer flash past in a limited four months leading into a brief, cold autumn.

The forest regions have winter, with heavy snows, for a good five months. Rivers freeze solid enough to sleigh on (making travel easier than usual). Spring comes with a ferocious thaw and flood leading to a modest summer and a long, cool autumn, with conditions improving marginally as one travels south. Around the latitude of Kiev one can expect really harsh weather to last only about four months.

Finally, the forest-steppe and steppe have only a three-month winter, though the long reach of the arctic winds blowing south can turn even the Crimea into a snow-locked fastness.

Travel

**Travel in Russia follows the rivers. They form an interlocking grid, with well-established portages “bridging” the intervening strips of land. Most roads are abominable. Little more than muddy ruts in spring and

autumn and dusty pathways in the summer, they vanish under winter’s snows. Conditions in Poland are similar, but the river network is less naturally useful, and as German influence increases in the 13th century, roads gradually improve.**

Wilderland

Low population and moderate levels of agriculture have had little effect on the overall vitality of the environment, nor have they remotely tamed it. Away from the heavily settled river valleys the traveler will swiftly find himself lost in a frontier land of sparsely settled dells and trackless woods. One wilderland area of particular interest is the **Pripet Marsh**.
- https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prypjats%C3%BCmpfe
	- This lies about a hundred miles to the northwest of Kiev, and out of it flows the Pripet River. There is no other area of freshwater marsh in Europe that remotely approaches the size of the Pripet: nearly 200 miles east to west and 150 north to south of reed bed and waterway, wandering channels, and vanishing rivers. The Pripet, like the northern forests, is primal wilderness, rich with mystery and hidden dangers.

Natural Resources

The Russian and Polish lands are rich in a wide variety of natural resources. Timber is the paramount building material; **furs, amber, honey, wax, and slaves** are the prime trade goods. **Iron ore is available in the swamps and shallow marshes**. The rivers overflow with fish, as do the many large and small lakes, while game of all kinds is readily available in forest and plain.

This is the land over which the magi of the Novgorod tribunal are pleased to hold mystical sway. In the following chapters we will delve more deeply into the character of the people who live here, and of the drama, pageant, toil, and tragedy of their lives.



# The Slavs
This chapter covers three areas: Russia, Poland, and the Baltic states. Russia is examined up to 1235, Poland to 1241. At these points their histories were savagely interrupted by the Mongol invasions. The invasions so completely change Russia that it is only sensible to treat the second half of the century after the Mongols have been discussed in detail. Poland was less seriously affected, but still badly damaged. Chapter 6 addresses the Mongols, their invasions, and the aftermath.

The Baltic states, however, are discussed right up to the end of the century. Their history is relatively uninterrupted and easily discussed as a whole

The Slavs

As previously mentioned, the early Slavs lived in small village communities, each composed of several Zadrugya (the “great family”), each made up of a group of brothers or male cousins, with their wives, children, and a few elderly relatives. A dozen or so villages would form a clan and several clans a tribe. Each tribe had a chieftain, usually elected, and a council of elders.

**The early Slavs lived at a typical iron-age level of agriculture and craftwork**. Technology has improved by the 13th century and the cities have grown up, but the agricultural basis of rural life remains much the same: hunting, bee-keeping, fishing, cereal and root crop cultivation, and stock breeding. Wood was the paramount building material. Rural dwellings followed one of two patterns. The northern house was a heavy log cabin (izba), often dug into the ground. The southern was a frame house (klet or khata), the walls filled with clay and stucco. All wooden structures and objects were richly decorated with carving and painting. The other principle arts of the Slavs, both ancient and medieval, were weaving, furriery, tanning, and ceramics.

Religion and Magic

The Slavs were Sun and Earth worshippers. They had many gods, most of whom shared attributes of Fire, Sun, and Fertility. Not all tribes chose to worship the same gods, but at the root of the Slavic religion was the simple notion that the world passed through an annual cycle of birth, growth, decay, death, and then rebirth.

This cycle was easily seen in the waxing and waning of the sun’s power and the turn of the seasons. Accordingly the Slavs marked the solstices and equinoxes with elaborate rituals. They especially celebrated the turn of midwinter (when the Sun was reborn), the coming of spring (the return of fertility) and the harvest season. Furthermore, they believed that the universe was organized around a mighty World Tree, an Oak, which pierced the three levels of existence: Heaven, Earth, and Hell.

What follows is a list of the major deities of the Slavs, with a few notes on their important attributes. For more detail see Appendix II, which begins on page 177.

Major Slavic Gods...

Svarog: King of the gods; a sun god of cosmic light, sun, and fire Mati-Syra-Zemlya: Mother Moist Earth;

nature and the world Perun: God of thunder, lightning, and war Svarozhich: A god of fire; one of Svarog’s sons Dazhdbog: A sun god; junior to Svarog; god

of creative light, sun, and fire Khors: The physical, astronomical sun Stribog: God of wind and air Iarilo: An aspect of Dazhbog, a fertility god;

particularly influential in springtime Volos: God of poetry, oracles, money, com-

merce, and cattle; many attributes Mokosh: Goddess of liberation and redemp-

tion; one of the few female divinities

...and Others

The Slavs worshipped three other sorts of beings.

• Ancestors: The dead watched over the clan’s fortunes, encouraged their descendants, and were often “feasted” by the sacrificial burning of food.

• Natural Objects: Particular rocks, trees, ponds, rivers, and lakes, all of whom possessed spirits (that is, faeries), many of them benevolent. There were spirits in the home and wilder, more mysterious spirits in the wilds.

• Animals: Deer and horses were popular totems, but any creature could serve as a spiritual protector.

The Volkhvy

The priests of the ancient Slavs were called Volkhv (plural: Volkhvy). They performed ritual sacrifices, gave prophecies, and practiced surgery. They were also gifted sorcerers. They could shapechange, travel vast distances in an instant, and hide themselves in conjured mists. Any tribal council of elders was composed mostly of Volkhvy.

Magic of the Living World

To the Slavs the world and the objects within it were alive, and sacred.

To the Slavs there was nothing, literally nothing, that didn’t partake in some measure of divinity: every tool, every ear of rye or barley, every animal, every drop of rain. And any activity could be assisted by knowledge of the proper incantations. A craftsman, it was thought, did not of himself perform his work. Instead, from his tools, he evoked their fundamental magic and encouraged them to do the work themselves.

History

The Slavs were never conquered by Rome or Charlemagne, and their known history begins around 850 AD. At this time they had broken into three groups. In the Balkans were the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes; in the northwest were the Poles and Czech-Slovaks. The last and largest group of Slavs were the eastern branch. These tribes, at least two dozen, inhabited European Russia, Byelorussia, and the Ukraine. Other important groups in the region included a variety of pagan Baltic tribes, particularly the Pomeranians, Prussians, and Lithuanians.

# Russia: Building the Nation

In Russia in 850 AD, the Khazars were the dominant power. The latest of the nomad hordes, they had settled in the northern Caucasus two centuries earlier and built their capital, Itil of the seven districts, in the delta of the Volga river. They had soon evolved into a trading people. Goods flowed across their lands from the Orient and Russia to the crowded bazaars of the middle east and the great markets of Byzantium. The Khazars extracted tribute from many of the Slavic tribes.

In more recent times a new group of nomads had arrived from the Finnish wastes, and allied with the Khazars. These were the Magyars and they lived due south of Kiev.

The third power in Russia were the Volga Bulgars. This was a Muslim state, less aggressive than the Khazars, but a unified realm, unlike the “Russian” tribes.

It was this situation into which the Vikings burst. The next two centuries were to be the Viking era. Brilliant mariners, they ruled the seas and would soon besiege Paris, seize London, and raid in Spain, Italy, and Germany.

In Russia they came down the rivers. They knew no mercy and acknowledged no boundaries to their ambitions. The Slavs called these savages Varangians, and in the course of a few decades they had penetrated the heart of Russia, with widely scattered bases as far south as the Crimea.

# Calling of the Varangians

The Varangians tormented the northern tribes. Resolving not to tolerate these invaders, the Slovenes, Krivichians, and Merians banded together and expelled them. Then, however, the victors fell to squabbling among themselves. Some order and rule were plainly needed to protect them from new bands of raiders, but what was to be done? The solution was simple. The tribes sent a message to Sweden. “Come,” they said to the Swedish princes, “and set some good man over us, that there be peace in our land.”

The man who answered this “calling of the Varangians” was the renowned Viking prince Rurik. He very swiftly established his rule in all the lands about the city of Novgorod, and the tribes paid him tribute. Though Rurik was fully occupied in the north, he also wanted to set up some authority in the south. Accordingly, around 859, he sent two lieutenants, Askold and Dir, to Kiev. They seized the city from the local Magyar warlord and began negotiations to gain passage down the Dnieper to the Black Sea. Their target was Constantinople.

Aided by mercenary bands of Varangians, and by Scandinavian settlers in the eastern Crimea (Tmutorokan), Askold and Dir succeeded in gathering over 200 ships and attacked in the summer of 861. By strength of arms and ruthlessness the invaders managed to besiege Constantinople.

Distraught, the people of the city turned to their Patriarch, Photius, who besought God’s mercy. In solemn procession, he led the assembled citizens to the harbor and washed in the water the Robes of the Virgin Mary. At once the sky darkened with massive storm clouds and the sea rose. When the skies cleared the whole shoreline was littered with shattered Varangian hulls.

Askold and Dir, with a few destitute followers, returned to Kiev. A treaty followed with Byzantium, and missionaries came to the south, establishing the first “Russian” see in Tmutorokan in 866.

In 873 Rurik died. He had never ruled a united land, only held a tenuous overlordship in the north. However, the failure of the southern war had brought trade in its wake, encouraging prosperity. Kiev was growing, and Novgorod was now at the head of a great chain of commerce.

First Unity

With Rurik dead his distant cousin Oleg, foster father to Rurik’s infant son Igor, ascended the Novgorodian throne. Oleg had been born in Livonia and was tutored in his youth in the Volkhv arts. He was young and ambitious and guided by a council of Volkhv “doctors.” Swiftly, Oleg set out to bring Russia together under one rule. In 878 he moved on the south, the northern tribes and many Varangians marching with him. He took first Smolensk then Lyubech, and finally Kiev which, Oleg declared, would be his capital, henceforth to be known as the Mother of Russian Cities.

The next decade or so of Oleg’s reign was heavy with challenges. In each region he dispersed Varangian garrisons and established set tributes to be paid when the prince passed through. Near Kiev, Oleg subdued the strongest Slavic tribes, the Radimichi, Drevliane, and Severi, forbidding them to pay tribute to the Magyars or Khazars. He fought and beat the Magyars for dominion in the south and taught the many Slavic tribes to think of themselves as one people, one nation.

In 897 the Magyars fell prey to a new people coming out of the east, the Patzinak Turks, or Pechenegi. Defeated, the Magyars fled into Hungary, clearing the route to Byzantium. Oleg did not hesitate. In 904 he mustered the tribes and hired mercenaries, assembling a force in the Crimea of over 500 ships.

Oleg descended upon Constantinople. Denied access to the Bosporus channel by great defensive chains, he put in to shore and ordered his men to affix wheels to their ships.

Thus equipped they sailed onward across the open lands until they were beneath the walls of the city. This time there was no heavenly salvation for the Byzantines, no Photius to call down God’s retribution on the pagans. The defense wavered and at last the Emperor had to offer a massive ransom: gold and jewelry and silken fabrics, as well as an advantageous trade treaty.

Before he departed, Oleg hung from the gates of the city his shield, symbol of peace.

In 907 and 911 further treaties were agreed. Commerce was proving more lucrative than war, and rapidly increased.

Oleg died in 912, stung to death by a venomous serpent, and was succeeded by Igor, Rurik’s son, a proud, avaricious man. He had a lengthy but undistinguished reign. His one true success was against Constantinople. In 941 it took only the threat of an invasion to bring the Byzantines scurrying north with offers of treasure and another generous treaty.

In 944 Igor died while attempting to extort from the Drevlianians a third tribute in a matter of a few months. The patience of the tribesmen was at an end; they had suffered from greedy Varangians under Igor’s general Sveneld, and then Igor himself. A third visit was one too many.

Olga and Sviatoslav: Church and Conquest

At the time of Igor’s death his only child, Sviatoslav, was an infant. However, Sviatoslav’s mother, Olga, was highly competent and secured the allegiance of the various tribes, groups of Varangians, and principal cities. She reformed the system of taxation, establishing a set rate of annual taxes collected by royal officers, thus reinforcing central authority. Her punishment of the Drevlianians was sharp, but not tyrannous; she executed their leaders, but did not drive the common people to rebellion.

Olga’s truly decisive step, however, was her conversion to Christianity. By this time

there were churches throughout Russia for the benefit of visiting merchants and the many local converts. Olga could see the advantages of taking up the new religion. A pagan Russia could never enjoy the diplomatic strengths of a Christian nation; she would always be treated as inferior and threatening, and would be a target for missionary activities that would undermine royal authority.

At the same time, Olga could see the dangers. If she accepted the Christian faith she would have to acquire clergy from one of two sources: the Patriarch of Constantinople or the Pope of Rome. If she did this, then Russia’s church would be dependent on foreigners. Furthermore, the Pope was aligned with the Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed authority over all princes and kings in the western world, while the Patriarch was even more closely linked to the Byzantine Emperor. If Russia converted, the nation would be faced with demands to acknowledge the overlordship of one or the other great religious leader, and one or other of the great temporal lords. What was to be done?

Olga stalled. She played diplomatic games, asked for priests to be sent first from one side then from the other, and did her best to be accepted as Christian without submitting to an established Christian authority.

It was a losing game, the more so because her son, Sviatoslav, by now coming into his manhood, was a devout pagan. She was, after all, only his regent and could not force her nation into Christianity. In 962 Olga stepped aside for Sviatoslav, taking up her abode in Kiev and withdrawing from politics.

Sviatoslav’s reign was brief, and briefly glorious. He immediately began to unite the Eastern Slavs and humble all of Russia’s traditional enemies. His ambitions were imperial and his character austere, but his achievements were shallow and ultimately selfdestructive.

In 963 he set out against the Khazars, razing their ancient citadel of Sarkel on the lower Don. In 964 he overwhelmed the Viatichian tribe, opening the way for a campaign against the Volga Bulgars, whose capital city, Great Bulgar, he stormed in 966. In

967 he prepared a great move against Constantinople, but was persuaded by Byzantine gold to invade the Balkans and crush the Danubian Bulgars instead. When the Pechenegi seized this opportunity to besiege Kiev, Sviatoslav turned back into Russia and relieved the city.

Sviatoslav had every intention of returning to Bulgaria, which seemed to him the fairest and richest land in all his vast domains. Firstly, however, he resumed his attack on the Khazars, taking and razing their ancient capital, Itil.

In 971 Sviatoslav returned to Bulgaria only to find the Bulgarians and Byzantines united against him. He was forced into a humiliating surrender. As he made his slow way back to Kiev, the Pechenegi, who had conspired with the Byzantines, ambushed his army and slew him. The Pechenegi Khan, Kuria, had the prince’s skull made into a goldplated goblet from which he drank.

Sviatoslav left two legacies, both ruinous. First, when he had set forth for Bulgaria for the last time, he had left his three sons behind him, Iaropolk ruling in Kiev, Oleg in the Drevlianian territory, and Vladimir in Novgorod. According to ancient Slavic rules of inheritance, the brothers should have cooperated in ruling Russia jointly, but none of them had the temperament for cooperation, and civil war soon broke out. Second, his conquest of the Khazars proved ill-considered. Certainly they had been a thorn in the Russians’ side, but they had also been a bulwark against new tribes from the east. With the Khazars crushed, there was nothing to stop the Pechenegi and they moved into the southern Russian steppes in strength.

The Seeds of Division

War came to Russia immediately after Sviatoslav’s death. Conflict erupted between Iaropolk and Oleg. By moving swiftly, Iaropolk surprised Oleg, and slew his brother while Vladimir fled to Scandinavia.

Matters did not rest there. Iaropolk was a Christian and was stricken with remorse at Oleg’s death. Vladimir, meanwhile, gathered Varangian supporters and returned in force. Now religion entered into the picture. Vladimir was a pagan, and there were still strong pagan forces in Russia. Iaropolk was ready to negotiate with Vladimir and agreed to meet, but at the meeting he was betrayed by the pagans among his men and handed over to Vladimir, who promptly executed him.

Vladimir was now sole ruler of Russia and soon proved himself a capable one, cannily sending his dangerous Varangian followers out of the country, and then securing his position by reinstating official, wide-scale paganism. Statues of the Old Gods were set up on the hills around Kiev, embellished with gold and silver. From his campaigns against the Poles, Lithuanians, and Volga Bulgars he acquired prisoners who were offered as human sacrifices.

The Missions to the Slavs

Byzantium was always the most active Christian missionary force among the Slavs. The great Patriarch Photius sent two eminent brothers, Constantine the Philosopher and Methodius to the north. Constantine, better known as Cyril, was a particularly outstanding thinker, preacher, and linguist, and translated the gospels into the Slavic tongue. To this end he had also composed a new alphabet, the “Cyrillic.”
Constantine and Methodius were active throughout the 860s, first in Khazaria, then in Bulgaria and the Czech lands. They were successful among the Czechs, but soon ran into difficulties with the proud German bishops. The brothers took their cause to Rome, where the Pope was impressed by their missionary zeal.
Constantine died in 869, apparently having been successful in winning the Pope’s approval for the crucial principle of allowing the Slavs to worship and read the Gospels in Slavic. Methodius struggled on against increasing difficulties at the Papal courts, and died with much of his work in ruins. They were swiftly canonized, however, and Saints Cyril and Methodius became the Patrons of the Slavic churches. Though the western Church won out in Czechoslovakia, they created a body of religious writings that were taken into Bulgaria and Russia. Thanks to them, “Church Slavonic” became the language of religion in Russia, and helped the Russians decide to turn to Eastern Orthodoxy.

---
Vladimir, like Olga before him, could see the value of leading his nation to Christianity or one of the other great religions. His envoys traveled to Constantinople, Rome, and Baghdad, examining the rituals and worship of each religion, and brought back word from the great cathedral of Sancta Sophia in Byzantium that “We knew not whether we were on Earth or in Heaven” so impressive were the rites celebrated there.

Vladimir was willing to throw over his paganism for the sake of his nation, and wise enough to choose his moment with care. When the Byzantine Emperor was faced by a terrible revolt and turned to the Russians, Vladimir’s conditions were steep: control of the Crimea and marriage to a Byzantine Princess of the highest lineage. To clinch the bargain Vladimir would convert to Eastern Christianity.

The Emperor agreed and Vladimir’s troops saved his throne. In 988 Vladimir was baptized and married to Anna, the sister of Emperor Basil II. Now the old altars and statues were torn down and the Volkhvy chased off  into the wilderness or slain. Mass baptisms were held in the rivers near Kiev and Novgorod, and bishoprics established atVladimir-in-Volinia, Polotsk, Turov, Belgorod, Rostov, Novgorod, and Chernigov. The Russian church was organized as a diocese subordinate to the Patriarch of Constantinople, but with a Metropolitan Bishop as its titular head, with his cathedral in Kiev.

For his works on behalf of the church Vladimir was eventually canonized (1263), and is known to the people of the 13th century as Vladimir the Saint. He died in 1014, and on his death the problem of inheritance and seniority blew up far more seriously. He had been a pagan and polygamist for the first thirty years of his life, and had several sons.

War exploded immediately. Two of the princes, Gleb and Boris, refused to fight, were murdered, and were eventually canonized. One, Iziaslav, stayed neutral, leaving princes Iaroslav, Sviatopolk, and Mstislav as the main contenders.

The war lasted from 1014 to 1019. The Poles became involved when their king, Boleslaw the Brave, marched in to support Sviatopolk, his son-in-law. All the contenders called on the services of Varangian and Pechenegi mercenaries. Eventually, Iaroslav overcame Sviatopolk and turned against Mstislav, whom he proved unable to defeat. Russia had broken apart, with Iaroslav ruling from Novgorod, Mstislav ruling from Chernigov, and Iziaslav controlling the small border district of Polotsk.

From 1019 until 1036 the realm remained divided. By and large the two senior brothers ruled without friction, and when Mstislav died childless in 1036 Iaroslav swiftly absorbed the southern realm. Polotsk, however, despite another 18 years of rule, he never retook.

Iaroslav ruled until 1054, and is remembered as Iaroslav “the Wise.” He fought a variety of campaigns against northern tribes such as the Iatvigians, struggled with the Byzantines and Pechenegi, and allied with the Polish king Casimir (the Restorer). Alas, he had too many sons and the ablest of them, Vladimir, died before him. On Iaroslav’s death, the realm was divided again.

Parallel Inheritance and the Principle of the Seniorate

The medieval Russians and Poles did not practice primogeniture. Instead, they followed an ancient Slavic law known as parallel inheritance, or (as the Poles came to call it) “the principle of the seniorate.” Among the ancient Slavs, any piece of land was held in common by a specific Zadrugya. Each Zadrugya would have a designated leader, commonly the eldest male. When that man died, his property passed in equal portions to his brothers first, and only later to his sons. Meanwhile, his authority would pass to his next oldest male relative, usually a brother.

In a small rural community this system worked. It promoted solidarity, encouraging everyone to feel equally involved in controlling their land. It did not work with a nation. Princes are seldom content to share anything. Another very unfortunate consequence was short reigns. Because rulership often passed from brother to brother the age differences were small and reigns were short. There was little time for the consolidation of power.

---

War began almost immediately when his grandson Rostislav seized the city of Galich. Rostislav was aided in this by a second young man, Vseslav of Polotsk.

Vseslav was something new in the royal House of Rurik. He was a Volkhv, and had a grisly reputation. He was born in a caul, and kept it with him always. He was a werewolf and a practitioner of dark arts and he meddled in the wars to ruinous effect.

Russia Shattered

Russia now suffered a long and painful period of decay. Occasionally a single powerful figure would briefly reunify the realm, but inevitably upon his death his sons, brothers, nephews, and cousins would fall out anew. By law this should not have happened. Parallel inheritance stated that on a man’s death his next oldest male relative should ascend to the senior position, and that all the junior princes should shuffle up one step, each getting a new city: a new, more important district. With a single exception matters simply never proceeded this smoothly.

Furthermore, as the House of Rurik continued fighting among themselves, royal “subclans” began to form. A man’s sons would take his name as their “patronymic” (for example, the sons of Sviatoslav would be termed the Sviatoslavichi) and each little clan of princes gradually assumed the right to one particular part of the realm. For instance, the Olgavichi soon came to be almost exclusively associated with Chernigov. Eventually, each royal sub-clan came to consider itself sovereign in its own realm, with only a vague acknowledgment that one among their number was senior prince.

It was during this period that the Cuman nomads came to Russia from the east. They attacked and absorbed the Pechenegi and settled in the rich southern steppe lands, cutting the Russians off from the Black Sea and raiding continually and aggressively throughout the south and east of the country.

The Last True Unity

In 1113 peace seemed, at last, to return to the beleaguered land of Russia. At the time the most respected prince was Vladimir Monomach of Pereyaslavl. When the current prince of Kiev died, the war-weary people of the city called on Vladimir to come and rule them. He declined. Parallel inheritance required that the throne of Kiev should not fall to him, but to a cousin. In Kiev his reluctance was unacceptable. The people rose in riot, attacking the homes of the clergy and rich boyars. In desperation these powerful men added their voices to those of the people: let Vladimir Monomach come to rule them!

This time Vladimir accepted, and restored order in Kiev. With the combined strength of Kiev and Pereyaslav he dominated first the south, and then the north of Russia. The petty squabbles of the princes were subdued and they acclaimed Vladimir as Grand Prince. When Vladimir died in 1125, a second stroke of luck became apparent; he had no surviving brothers. Control of the realm passed directly to his son, Mstislav the Great.

Mstislav reconquered independent Polotsk. His son Vsevolod invaded eastern Estonia, and his brother Iaropolk defeated the Cumans twice. But such times were not to last. Mstislav died in 1132, and his brother Iaropolk ascended the throne in Kiev. Iaropolk was a fine warrior, but could not enforce the obedience of his brothers and cousins. Trouble flared with the Olgavichi of Chernigov. The Cumans attacked and could not be subdued. When Iaropolk died in 1139 unity had crumbled.

The Century of Despair

For the next hundred years, from 1139-1237, Russia suffered many sharp moments of turmoil and short periods of uneasy peace. There were scores of minor wars, and several great ones. As time passed, certain trends emerged.

First, parallel inheritance proved no better at holding districts together than a nation. When a clan established an hereditary right to a district they swiftly fell prey to the disease of internal rivalry. Accordingly a system of sub-districts sprang up. Smaller and smaller divisions of the main districts were imposed to satisfy each princeling of his proper share. But Russia did not peel apart into hundreds of tiny baronies. Many princes died without leaving heirs. Many princes were cut out of their inheritances. Many small districts were absorbed by aggressive senior princes.

Second, Kiev was the prize for which the princes struggled most ferociously. After Mstislav the Great no prince sat on the throne of Kiev who could truly call himself Grand Prince, but even after the Suzdalians sacked the city in 1169 its prestige remained high.

Third, foreign intervention became commonplace. By now the Russian princes had marriage ties to all the central European monarchies as well as to the Cuman Khans, the Byzantines, and the Scandinavians. The princes became used to calling on their relatives for assistance, while interlopers seized what they could.

Fourth, very rarely did Russian princes die in battle. When rival forces came up against each other they were usually fighting over a fairly trivial issue. With one good look at who had the bigger army, confrontation gave way to reconciliation or flight. Church mediation helped prevent truly bloody battles and Russian princes generally exiled erring relatives.

Fifth, cities fell easily. Almost inevitably the people within the walls would split into factions and excitable crowds. It was quite simple to rouse a mob against a rival prince, for most princes had little more loyal follow-
ing than the forces of their own personal retinue and armed retainers (their Druzhina).

Sixth, a last damaging factor, was the growth of the Boyar class. The Boyars were the middling nobility of Russia: men who held land and commanded followings. **Some of them were descended from the princes of the original Slavic tribes and some from Varangian chieftains. Others were wealthy merchants who had taken up landholding or the mayors of small cities.** The Boyars resisted princely rule because it inhibited their power to do as they pleased. Regardless, no Boyar ever managed to permanently take control of a principality. The Russian princes all remained descendants of the House of Rurik. The statement, “We are all children of one grandfather,” expressed their sense of fellow feeling, not that it affected their behavior.

Seventh, the Church was a strong moderating influence, constantly involved in diplomacy and mediation, sometimes managing to win mercy for defiant cities or errant princelings.

# Russia: Early 13th Century

By the early 13th century Russia had been divided into several principalities, which are described in the following sections.

Novgorod

A city-state in its own right, Novgorod has expanded into a vast sweep of northern land, setting up small towns and a system of trading stations and outposts as far east as the Urals. Traditionally independent, with a rowdy democratic manner, Novgorod has always taken a prince from the House of Rurik. The city needs a prince to lead its armed forces, but its citizens have never tolerated dictators, and the current situation, where there is always someone who can be persuaded to come and oust their current ruler, usually plays into the hands of the city.

The City of Novgorod

Novgorod is split by the shallow river Volkhov: on the west is the “Sophia” side, on the east is the “market” side. The city is lowlying and moated, but the Volkhov is not a turbulent river and floods are rare. Fires are far more common and damaging.

There are five districts in the city: the Neverskij, the Plotnickij (carpenters and shipbuilders), the Zacorod (castle district/Boyars’ palaces), the Ljudin (home to the potters, smiths, and silversmiths), and the Slavno (the oldest and poorest district).

The most important area in the city is the Great Marketplace, where the Veche meets. The market contains the churches and halls of the Russian and foreign merchants, and the ancient palace of Iaroslav the Wise, nowadays the home of the Posadnik and meeting-place of the Sovet Gospod (see the insert on page 28). The palace is also the site of the Veche bell, which is rung to summon the freemen of the city. The Veche has little patience with unsatisfactory princes, and very often “showed them where to go.”

The folk-hero of Novgorod is Sadko the Merchant, who was famous for his daring expeditions. The city is intensely involved in Baltic trade, and has a strong Hanseatic League community. Novgorod dominates the import of Flemish cloth, Luneburg salt, and English wool.

Suzdalia

Since Andrei Bogolubosky sacked Kiev in 1169, Suzdalia has generally been referred to as the Grand Principality, and is now the real power in the north. At the turn of the century the ruler was Vsevolod III (reigned 1172-1212) who gave the title “Grand Prince” some real meaning. Novgorod had elected only his sons to rule it for ten years, and the principalities of Pereyaslavl and Ryazan were under his control. The capital of Suzdalia is Vladimir-in-Suzdalia, and is now the third great city of Russia.

Vladimir The City

The city has four main divisions. The western segment is the New Town. The central segment is the Middle Town, also known as Monomach’s Town. The eastern segment is the Posad, a district of tradesmen and craftsmen. Set against the southern wall in the Middle Town is the heavily fortified stone Citadel.

Vladimir is distinguished by the amount of fine white stone used in its walls, buildings, and gates, and also by the bridge over the Lybed. It dazzles most newcomers with its many gilded domes and ornate church façades.

Ryazan

One of those small districts that split off from a larger one in the last century, it is generally loyal to the princes of Suzdalia. Even here there is a tendency to fragment. The city of Murom often struggled for independence.

Smolensk

When Vladimir Monomach died in 1125 this principality passed to his grandson, Rostislav, and from then onward fell solely under the authority of the Rostislavichi. In general well-ruled, the region was held together and not allowed to fragment further.

Chernigov

By 1170 the local clan had taken on the patronymic of their ancestor Oleg (hence, “Olgavichi”). By the turn of the century there were two ruling lines and the land was partitioned. Ruling from Chernigov city itself was the senior prince, while the junior ruled from Novgorod-Seversk.

Polotsk

Polotsk had only three rulers in the entire 11th century: Iziaslav (1014-1036), Bryacheslav (1036-1044), and Vseslav (the Sorcerer, 1044-1101). Polotsk suffered terribly in the 12th century; Vseslav’s many sons virtually tore it apart. But in 1128 Mstislav the Great marched in and exterminated the line. Polotsk is reasonably solidly ruled at this time, but is already suffering from the Lithuanian raids which will eventually destroy it.

Volinia and Galicia

The westernmost of the Russian principalities. United from 1199 to 1205 by Roman of Volinia, these two districts suffered most intensely from Hungarian and Polish interference and invasion. After the death of Roman of Galicia, the two districts split apart again, and Galicia was most frequently the target of opportunistic local Boyars, Hungarians, and Polish adventurers. Damaged by the brief usurpation of Vladislav the Boyar in 1212, Galicia enters the 13th century in a turbulent, strife-torn state.


Kiev

Smaller, older, and more run down than robust Suzdalia, the southern border of the principality has become a fluid, shifting line due to constant nomad raids. Though Kiev’s defensive siting was good and its trade routes excellent, its power declined throughout the late 12th century.

Kiev The City

The city is split into four districts. The Old Town is the original, fortified position and is now the site of the prince’s palaces. The Gora is the aristocratic district, site of the Sancta Sophia cathedral and the Metropolitan Bishop’s court. The Foreign Quarter is an area set aside for foreigners, Poles, Hungarians, German merchants, and Jews. The Podol is the traders’ and craftsmens’ quarter, and holds the bulk of the population.

Outside Kiev is the Monastery of the Caves. This is the oldest and most influential monastery in Russia. The original catacombs, which the early monks dug out with their own hands, still exist, but have been replaced by a compound of fine churches and the great Dormition Cathedral.

Pereyaslavl

Pereyaslavl was the battleground where the nomads were fought. The principality was politically and militarily dependent on Kiev and ruled by the Monomashichi clan (the descendants of Vladimir Monomach) for most of the 12th century until the commanding figure of Vsesvolod III took control.

Pinsk-Turov

This little western principality never had much to build on, as most of its territory is dominated by the inhospitable Pripet Marsh. Its independence is continually forfeit to the attentions of the Kievans and the Volinians.

City Government

Any big city of Russia has three principle segments of government.

• Veche: The assembly of free male citizens who serve in the city militia.

• Tysiatsky: The Militia Commander. An elected post, determined by the Veche. Princes, boyars, mayors, and councils all tried to influence the elections for these positions.

• Posadnik: The Mayor. The senior civil officer, at once an administrator and a magistrate. Again, an elected post.

The degree of authority held by these people depended on how much power the local prince had. Novgorod had by far the strongest tradition of local autonomy and the people usually supported their own officers over the prince.

Novgorod is in fact a special case. Aside from the above three organizations, it had a fourth one, the Sovet Gospod: the Council of Lords. This was composed of wealthy citizens and local Boyars. Together with the Posadnik and Tysiatsky, they formed an executive council, which tried to run the city in its own interest.


# The Russian Orthodox Church

Generally, the Russian Church preached tolerance. Though there were Western churches in Russia, and many Jews, there was relatively little friction. The church strove to outlaw slavery, and to mediate the princely squabbles. They were also the scholars and teachers of Russia. However, this was scholarship from the Greek tradition, not the Latin. An educated churchman spoke and read Church Slavonic first, Greek second, and Latin a distant third.

As it was Western, very little needs to be said about the Polish Church. Interested readers are referred to Mythic Europe and Pax Dei. The Russians, however, turned to the East, giving their church a distinctly different spirit and organization. One important difference was that their clergy were of two distinct sorts, the “white” and the “black” (though it is important to note that these distinctions were informal and not canonical designations).

The White Clergy

The white clergy performed all of the parish duties and menial work. They were ordained as priests (usually elected by their congregations), as deacons, and as junior church officials. The white clergy were required to marry.

The organization of parish churches in Russia was very weak. Few villages had a church and priest of their own. Instead they would be served by an itinerant priest, who was doing well if he managed one visit to each village once each year.

The Black Clergy

The black clergy were monks. Each was attached either to a monastery (usually close to a city) or to a cathedral. They were celibate and automatically took precedence over the white. Only members of the black

clergy became bishops. They followed the tradition of St. Theodosius, and the clearest statement of their credo was made by Abbot Feodosi of the Monastery of the Caves (near Kiev): “Prayer, humility, work, charity.” These were the key to a life of devotion. A very few monks did follow the alternate teachings of St. Anthony, which stressed seclusion, poverty, and mortification, but they were a small minority.

The Metropolitan and the Bishops

A Metropolitan was the leading bishop of any province subject to the Patriarch of Byzantium. The senior cleric in Russia was the Metropolitan Bishop of Kiev.

It was the Metropolitan’s responsibility to circulate the doctrinal rulings issued by Byzantium. He created new sees, appointed junior bishops, and corrected or dismissed them. The Metropolitan (and Russia as a whole) never sent any kind of tithe back to Byzantium, and only seldom journeyed to Constantinople to attend Patriarchal synods.

The Metropolitan was, however, chosen by the Patriarch. The Russian bishops would gather in conclave and select three candidates from among the black clergy, whose names would be forwarded to the Patriarch for final selection. The Metropolitans and the majority of senior black clergy were almost always Greek rather than Russian.

Metropolitans of the 13th Century

Nikifor II 1185-1208
Matfey 1209-1224 
Kirill I 1224-1234 
Iosif 1235-1240 (killed in Mongol sack of Kiev)

Vacant from 1240-1250 
Kirill II 1250-1281

Maksim 1283-1305

The second-ranking bishop was the Archbishop of Novgorod. Then there were the “common” bishops. By the beginning of the 13th century there were sees in Belgorod, Chernigov, Galich, Peremyshl, Pereyaslavl, Polotsk, Rostov, Ryazan, Smolensk, Suzdal, Turov, Vladimir-inSuzdalia, Vladimir-in-Volinia and Tmutorokan. In 1261 the Metropolitan Kirill II will create a new see, at Sarai, the capital of the Mongol Golden Hoard.



Canon Law

The clergy in general were subject only to the judgment of their bishops. However, legal conflicts between the church and lay people were always bought before a mixed court.

Saints

Several saints have already been mentioned. They are listed here, along with several others who were popular, and their western equivalents. This list also indicates the pagan gods (in parentheses) who became confused with specific Christian saints.

As an aside, it should be noted that this confusion of pagan gods and Christian saints can sometimes pose a problem for storyguides and troupes, since in Mythic Europe, Faerie and Divine auras are concretely different in terms of the way they affect magic. If this problem rears its head in your saga, the best bet is to talk it through as a group in order to come to a solution that respects your troupe’s conception of Mythic European cosmology and the particular circumstances in question. No single solution published here will have any hope of doing justice to the myriad instances in the plethora of sagas using this material. It wouldn’t hurt to remember that the perceptions of common people are often misguided, manipulated, and just plain mistaken.

The Position of Women

Eve was the agency of Adam’s fall from grace. It therefore followed that she was the devil’s vessel and women were accordingly tainted. On the other hand the worship of Mary, the Mother of God, was elevated in the Eastern tradition. This tended to glorify woman as authors of salvation. These difficulties aside, there were many convents in Russia. Outside the royal houses they were practically the only venues within which women could win education.

The Eastern Church and Magic

The priesthood in Russia has had a long and frustrating fight with stubborn pagan hold-outs and the Volkhvy. While officially tolerant of Islam and Judaism, they are altogether set against paganism of any kind. Their view of magic is heavily influenced by this, although unlike the Western Church, they have no tradition of inquisition.

In game terms, Russian priests are capable of administering the sacraments and performing all other priestly functions mentioned in Pax Dei. They have Piety scores and occasionally True Faith.
