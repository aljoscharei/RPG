Revisiting the RPG cartography standard

Once again donning my OCD hat, I’m compelled to implement a standard for mapping areas of my campaign. The goal is to use a consistent scale for areas of a certain size, as well as a static grid system that helps me drill down to sub-maps and note the locations of prominent campaign features. Given my earlier posts this month, it should be no surprise that I find my solution in the hex map.

## Hex Mapping Standards

Back in the Dim Ages, Judges Guild created an excellent hex mapping standard based on the 5-mile wilderness hex. Each hex was divided into 1-mile sub-hexes, and each of _those_ hexes could be divided into 0.2-mile sub-hexes. You could create smaller sub-hexes by dividing the current width by five. This approach made mapping easier because each hex was composed of the same number of sub-hexes; this meant you could use the same hex template for any area you needed to map—all you had to do was change the scale of each hex.

Another great format was created by Columbia Games, who placed a Cartesian grid system over a hex map, which was great for atlas-size maps that illustrated land shape, terrain type, and only the most prominent features. Locations were noted by grid coordinates, and sub maps would show the “atlas” hexes for reference.

So why not combine the two for a composite mapping standard?

## Atlas Template

[![unknown_filename.15.png](./resources/201909200008_Hex_Templates___The_Welsh_Piper.resources/unknown_filename.15.png)](https://www.welshpiper.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hexTemplate_atlas_landscape.pdf)

Atlas Template (landscape)

The Atlas template is composed of blocks that measure 5 hexes square, and is used to represent continents, sub-continents, island chains, or any other large-scale area. If you’re mapping a truly large area, you can “stitch” multiple Atlas templates together.

For convenience, we’ve provided both landscape and portrait orientations of the Atlas template, with a block in each for the map title and key.

## Regional Template

[![unknown_filename.2.png](./resources/201909200008_Hex_Templates___The_Welsh_Piper.resources/unknown_filename.2.png)](https://www.welshpiper.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hexTemplate_regional.pdf)

Regional Template

The Regional template represents a single block on the Atlas template. The large hexes are Atlas-scaled at 25 miles each, while the smaller, regional hexes are 5 miles across.

Most campaign maps would be at this scale, which provides enough space to view a large area, but with enough detail to note features. There’s a blank area at the bottom for the map title and key.

## Local Template

[![unknown_filename.9.png](./resources/201909200008_Hex_Templates___The_Welsh_Piper.resources/unknown_filename.9.png)](https://www.welshpiper.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hexTemplate_local.pdf)

Local Template

The Local template represents a single hex of the Atlas template, but broken into 5-mile (regional) and 1-mile (local) sub-hexes. This approach lets you detail a 25-mile Atlas hex without doing any conversion math in your head.

This template is good for detailing active areas of the campaign–the PCs’ home base and surroundings, a sandbox of adventure sites and points of interest, or even an overview map of a sprawling cave complex. As always, there’s a blank area at the bottom for the map title and key.

## Sub-hex Template

[![unknown_filename.18.png](./resources/201909200008_Hex_Templates___The_Welsh_Piper.resources/unknown_filename.18.png)](https://www.welshpiper.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hexTemplate_subhex.pdf)

Sub-hex Template

The Sub-hex template represents a single hex, divided into smaller sub-hexes. This representation is useful at any scale, but especially for detailed areas of a local map (for example, you could divide a 1-mile hex into 0.2 mile sub-hexes). The key at the map’s right edge contains blank areas for noting the scale you choose.

## Hex Template Scales

For reference, use the table below to determine template measurements:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Template** | **Hex Scale\[1\]** | **Hex Area\[2\]** | **\# Hexes** | **Map Area\[2\]** |
| Atlas | 25 miles | 541 sq. mi. | 750 | 405,950 sq. mi. |
| Regional | 5 miles | 21.65 sq. mi. | 750 | 16,238 sq. mi. |
| Local | 1 mile | 0.866 sq. mi. | 625 | 541 sq. mi. |
| Sub-hex | 0.2 miles | 0.035 sq. mi. | 100 | 3.5 sq. mi. |
| Sub-hex | 0.04 miles | 0.0014 sq. mi. | 100 | 0.14 sq. mi. |
| **Footnotes**<br><br>1.  Hex height, or distance between parallel sides<br>2.  In square miles, rounded |     |     |     |     |

    Fantastic! Do you have a version with the smaller numbered hexes without the larger hexes superimposed on top. I use Photoshop.

    I’ve been inspired into making a set of templates in Inkscape 0.46 for these Erin which will allow me to map in my own peculiar mannerisms, more “drawn” than plug in. I’ve got the hexes snapping together nicely so far.

    [@Erin Smale](https://www.welshpiper.com/hex-templates/#comment-594) Why sure. I’ll send the Atlas and Regional templates along. At the moment I do not have any terrain and habitation style “hexes” drawn up, just the basis of the template.
    
    My plan is to complete the three templates and then work on the hexes to duplicate and snap. I’ve broken things into layers which will be locked, from top down Border Text, Border, Grid (Atlas), border blanking (crops the base hexmap beyond the border), Hexmap Atlas, and finally U Draw. So the layer you’ll draw on is below everything else. The others are locked.
    
    My intention is to subdivide the U Draw layer into sublayers Text, Icons, Terrain Icons, Roads, Rvers, Hex Colours, etc. However, I intend to include a bunch of artwork for the Icons which I haven’t done yet. I’ll probably be using my Gnomeyland artwork as the basis for that due to the fact that I want to avoid any issues and the fact that it’s just plain time to move on – YO!
    
    The good part of all this is it will be vector art. I’ve encountered a little wierdness with the polygon tool so my hexes are not perfectly symetrical. I’ve fudged them a little to fit into a square, and by using snap to nodes, I find that if the square is subdivided into four, the hexes snap perfectly, so that lines overlap rather than adjoin. I’m using metric by the way so the hexes are approximately 1 cm, but the paper size is 11×17. Printed to pdf, or saved to PNG, it should provide very clear output. They look quite good, acceptable to me anyway.
    
    The “icons” will be drawn in a square box or hexes, but I haven’t decided which yet. Hey, aren’t I supposed to be working on my Chimera module?

    Just installed [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) and am about to start playing with it. Great icons, Greg – these are truly inspired. Hope to produce something worthy of your work soon.

    Oh, your welcome Erin. Your templates are inspired! Your not the only one with OCD. Once I get an idea in my noggin it’s hard to let go.
    
    I’ve got this sorted out some more to the point where it’s now truly useful and I’ll send along two inkscape templates for you to tinker with, an inkscape development file within which I illustrate an example to go along with the all important tutorial in which I actually seem to explain what I’m getting at. What was I thinking?
    
    I’m really glad you like the icons, they are based on old 19th century map icons and old map colours. The set is far from complete or finished. However, I’ve added a few more bits of art for your immediate enjoyment. ![unknown_filename.27.svg](./resources/201909200008_Hex_Templates___The_Welsh_Piper.resources/unknown_filename.27.svg)

    Hah! ![unknown_filename.27.svg](./resources/201909200008_Hex_Templates___The_Welsh_Piper.resources/unknown_filename.27.svg) Your not the only one distracted. Serves you right for making those templates in the first place. Now my OCD is really kicking in… I’ve got to sort these icons out a bit, Gnomeyland is getting mixed up with the “historical” physiographic symbols. Plus, I’d found the maps of Hampshire, which really got the creative flow going. So I’ve sent you a link to those as well. ![unknown_filename.21.svg](./resources/201909200008_Hex_Templates___The_Welsh_Piper.resources/unknown_filename.21.svg)

    Trying to load the templates into Hexographer gives an error, something about FCW… any chance these aren’t compatible with the newest Hexographer? Or am I just hopelessly lost? ![unknown_filename.27.svg](./resources/201909200008_Hex_Templates___The_Welsh_Piper.resources/unknown_filename.27.svg)
    
    Cheers for the awesome thoughts on hex design.

    [@Dale](https://www.welshpiper.com/hex-templates/#comment-3852) : Sounds like you may be trying to load the wrong files. For Hexographer, use the \*.hxm files in the download (the FCW format is a reference to Campaign Cartographer). Let me know if that sorts it.

    A ha! I Was indeed loading the cc3 FCT files… the irony of it all is that I have CC as well and didn’t even notice the extension.
    
    I like CC3 when I want to make beautiful maps… but rarely have the requisite 40+ hours to put in to a single map… happy to learn about hexographer!

    Hi, Erin,
    
    I just discovered Chimera while looking at Fractal Mapper (which I can’t afford at the moment – I’m building a patio). Thank you for the free Basic (I’ve since purchased the Chimerapedia Core). I’ve been looking for just this kind of thing to reawaken the flavor of the old-school D&D that I cut my teeth on back in the day without all the unwieldy and unnecessary rules and learning curve. My partner and I look forward to making Chimera our go-to system for future games.
    
    Also, thanks for adding the .png files, above. That saves me a step in coverting the .pdfs to .png. I look forward to using them as I create my maps, either by hand (which I’ve been doing for almost 30 years) or in Fractal Mapper when I’m able to get it.
    
    As I create my new fantasy gaming world for Chimera, I will post creature conversions, treasure stats, and the like as updates to my world-building blog. It’s still in its infant stages – only 3 posts so far – but here’s the URL: <http://rpgworldbuilding.blogspot.com/>
    
    Best wishes for the growing and continued success of Chimera.

    [@October MacBain](https://www.welshpiper.com/hex-templates/#comment-4454) : October, thanks for checking out Chimera. I’m really happy to see you using it as the basis for your new campaign. I’ve added your blog to the Links section (at right) – I really like how you’re describing the setting through Chimera mechanics. Biased that I am, it’s great material!

    Are these available with the hexes in rows, instead of columns? I tried rotating them in Hexographer and the aspect ratio was all off. Alternatively, could you give me the heights and widths?

        Hi Spazz – Opinion noted. For early D&D-like games, where movement rates are based on multiples of 3, a 6-mile hex being easier and tidier math. For games where movement rates are based on multiples of 5 (like Chimera, for example), the 5-mile hex works just fine.

        Hi T0ss – They don’t. It seems to me that hex scale preference is based on how well it conforms to a given RPG’s movement system.
        
        For example, in xD&D, movement rates are based on multiples of 3, so a matching hex scale makes the math easy when determining how far a party can move in the wilderness. For example, daily mileage in Cook’s Expert D&D is a PC’s movement rate (30′, 60′, 90′ or 120′) divided by 5 (X19). This always gives a multiple of 6: 30/5 = 6; 60/5 = 12; 90/5 = 18; 120/5 = 24. A 6-mile hex makes it very easy to see how far a character can travel in a day.
        
        In systems where movement is based on multiples of 5 (like Chimera), a 5-mile hex does the same thing. I’d offer that a 5-mile hex also has the advantage of intuitive math – we’re arguably more used to counting things off by fives than by sixes – so when viewing hex maps at that scale, it may also be a little easier for us to understand distances.
        
        It’s certainly possible to create 6-mile versions of the hex templates here, but I have to confess that it’s not a priority for me, given available time. However, if there’s enough demand, I could be persuaded to bump it up on the list.

    I just found all of these fantastic materials from you guys and the world ive been working on for months is in a massive hex overhaul that I’m super excited about. I was just wondering though how you came to get your hex areas? cause a 25 mile diagonal hex would have an area of 405.9 sq miles, 5 mi – 16.2 sq mi, etc… so I was just curious if youre measuring them as circles or how it was done

    Hi Desk – these templates establish hex width between sides, not diagonals. Based on width (W), Area = (sqrt (3) / 2) \* W^2 or 0.866 \* W^2
    For a 25 mile hex (i.e., 25 miles from side to side), area is 0.866 \* 25^2 = 541.25 square miles. For a 5 mile hex, area is 0.866 \* 5^2 = 21.65 square miles.

        Hi Brian – The hex template is an overlay of Hexographer’s native hex grid, which are supposed to be “sub-hexes” of the larger hex. When you load it, you should see the template hex at a height of 5 hexographer hexes. But if I’m misinterpreting, send me a note via the Contact Us form and I can dig deeper.
