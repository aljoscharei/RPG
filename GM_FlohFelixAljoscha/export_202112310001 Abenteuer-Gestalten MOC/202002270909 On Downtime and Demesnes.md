# Civilization

This is the core conflict within Dungeons and Dragons.

The game has the quintessence of the eternal conflict between the age of flame and the age of darkness, reality versus the subconscious, Law versus Chaos.

There must be an unknown! Exploring this hostile space is the primary focus of the game and rules. But it was never intended as the entirety of the experience. Gygax provided rules for acquiring and pacifying domains, envisioning the changing arc of play at high levels.

Defining civilization as a background is a key component of play. There are certain basic assumptions regarding civilization in the rules. The first assumption is that Law, and the ideal of human civilization, is actively at war with forces of Chaos. A castle will be able to control and pacify lands up to nine miles distant, or a radius of one six-mile hex.

Beyond that, Chaos actively presses in. Due to this influence, national organization is cursory in nature. Castles may have an official representative or two who are agents of a larger nation state. Only near the stabilizing influence of castles can civilization flourish! This is the meaning behind a ‘points of light’ setting.

Cities

Dungeons and wilderness can be explained away with ancient empires, ruined lands, and magic. But cities are built and lived in by humanlike creatures. Someone a player can talk to has to be there. This places guidelines on urban areas that don’t exist for other adventure locations1.

People have to eat.

Either a city must be entirely self-sustaining, or it must be near enough to a place that produces food. This means that city/ hamlet placement is almost entirely dictated by the distance a family can travel in a full day. A larger city or castle must be supported by a smaller network of cities at one-half that distance. This central city would support a market for hamlets who could not produce enough to feed themselves. In medieval times this distance was approximately 4 miles, and expanded as roads and transportation improved.

Another option for adventures in civilized areas is a non- agrarian society made up of hunter-gatherers or nomadic people. Hunter-gathering societies can be static (although small) in very resource rich environments, such as jungles. The difference between the two population densities is pretty significant. Hunter-gatherer or dry-farming societies have .02-2 people per square mile. Settled agrarian lands will be somewhere between 30 to 120 people per square mile. These are minimums and maximums, the upper extreme is rarely reached. Nearly all of these people will be located in population centers a few miles from each other.

## Contents of a civilized six-mile hex:

• usually 1 fortification or small castle  
• a large village or town  
• at least two smaller hamlets, up to 8, averaging about 4

## Contents of an uncivilized six-mile hex:

• Several ruins  
• one or two small population centers (up to about 50 people) 
• up to 6 alpha predator monster lairs

This doesn’t necessarily mean that the cities must be human. Non-humans, variant ancestries, or demi-humans might be considered if there are enough natural resources. Fishing, hunting, and wild plants could keep a bullywug village of a fairly large size fed, considering the reduced calorie requirements of 4 foot tall cold-blooded amphibians. Uncivilized hexes could support much larger populations if trade or sustainable agriculture were practiced.

Also, it’s a fantasy world. Access to the underdark, a cloning machine, growing young from vats, interplanetary portals, divine shepherding, axiomatic covenant, watery tarts living in lakes handing out magic swords, wish spells, et al. all could affect population density.

# Cities
What are the procedures for interesting gameplay, and how do cities provide those?

There are 5 city types (X54 in Cook Expert)

Thorp ≤ 20
Hamlet  ≤50 
Village 51-1,000
Town  1,000-5,000
City 5,000-15,000
Metropolis 15,000+

What is the in-game purpose of a civilization center?

The answer to this question is dependent on the context. What do players want to do in a city?

-   Is there ___ shop?
-   Is the town avoidable? Dangerous? How will our arrival be received?
    
-   Who of import lives in the town?
    
-   What religions and languages are spoken in the town?
    
-   What do the townspeople have?
    
-   Where can we rest?
    
-   What does the town have in the way of supplies?
    
-   Are there any quests or adventure seeds?
    
-   What does the town have to offer us?
    
-   What’s the punishment for a crime?
    
-   Why are we not bored? i.e. what is of interest, individual, or
    
    unique about the village?

# Clearing and securing Terrain

Before characters can construct anything lawfully, they must own the land. This requires a deed or claim. Characters can be granted this by the lord that ostensibly "owns" the land (see Influence p.178), or they can kill anyone who challenges their claim.

The player makes a declaration on the type of land she seeks, such as a hill overlooking a river, and the Dungeon Master will create a location and map where it is, along with the six surrounding hexes.

The first procedure is that the land must be explored and mapped. This follows standard rules for wilderness exploration. [[202104290619 Todd Into the Wild#Hex Exploration p 19]] Note that this is not travel: wilderness exploration and mapping takes place at the rate of one 1320' hex per turn. It takes approximately 96 work-hours to fully explore and map a six-mile hex. This is twelve days of exploration per hex. It requires approximately 84 days (3 months) of exploration and random encounter rolls to map and clear seven six-mile hexes. One six-mile hex is the minimum amount of land that must be cleared in order to begin construction. Random monsters are considered to remain in the hex until killed or driven off, unless they are flying or travelling through. These random encounters are separate from the lairs.
compare [[202104290619 Todd Into the Wild#Hex Exploration p 19]]

If the land is wild, uncivilized, and chaotic, the hex must be cleared of monster lairs. Each hex will possess 1d4+2 such lairs. The untamed hexes may contain ruins, small towns and hamlets, dungeons, and other strangeness. Only the lairs must be cleared in order to begin construction. If the land is civilized, construction can begin immediately.

After being cleared, once per day a wandering monster check is made per adjacent wild hex to see if a monster has wandered into a cleared hex. Once per week a check is made to determine if a monster has wandered into a cleared hex surrounded by cleared hexs. Actively patrolling will keep these checks from being made.

Settlers can be attracted to cleared areas by the characters spending money to construct improvements such as roads, inns, mills, boat yards, and other facilities. The specifics of who arrives and how many are related to the campaign world and remain in the preview of the Dungeon Master. For every 100 gp the characters spend, the characters attract one family of 5 people. Each citizen will play about 2 gp in taxes (as profit) every year to the owners to assist in the maintenance and control of the land.
