-   Enough connections? Soap opera.
    

Three seeds to plant for future development (Starters for new trails or investigations for the players)

Three recurring threads to weave back in (Elements from the previous session or earlier that need to make a reappearance so they're developed or not forgotten)

Plot. Wie erfahren die PCs davon?

Three plot-moving revelations that might occur (These are elements that impact the big picture story. They're the one's I'd like to move forward on or which seem to be top of the players' minds at the moment. I won't always get to any or all of these things, they just serve to remind me not to be too static. In the example above, I don't think the players have actually had that answered directly, but it hasn't had that great an impact yet).

Scenes with Impressions

Three "tone-setting" events for genre-flavor (The idea being that each session should remind the players of the distinctiveness of the game they are playing. So in this case I have something that reminds them of the local politics and the Exalted world, something that references local customs, and something that reinforces that this is an urban game.)

Three conflicts that might happen in the game (I read conflicts as any significant challenge, be it combat, problem solving, chases or whatever)

Three puzzles, dilemmas or moral choices (I usually use these to note unanswered questions or mysteries hanging over the group. Sometimes I'll come up with a small ethical choice situation, but more rarely)

Three Things to do for critical Failures, Critical Successes, Bail-outs (I often find this the hardest thing to come up with. Ideally this would be a place to note opportunities to present or punishment/consequences for bad rolls or bad decisions. Here I've noted three strokes of good luck. I sometimes use these to reward players who roll extremely well on incidental rolls. There's nothing worse than rolling critical successes on a spot check where there's nothing unusual to see).

Something novel for each PC (This wasn't in the original document I modeled this on. I use this for catch-all, especially if I haven't done a list of “Three Things” for each PC as I mentioned in my previous post).

-   III. Der Spielleiter schmückt die fünf Punkte mit Details aus. Wieder schreibt er alles auf, was ihm einfällt – in beliebiger Reihenfolge.
    
-   Zusammen ergibt sich daraus schnell ein komplettes Bild. Es ist sinnvoll, zunächst alles – auch die scheinbar unpassenden oder langweiligen Punkte – stehen zu lassen. Meist fügt sich alles nach und nach in die Geschichte ein. Der Bär mag als Beispiel dienen

# Adventure Name

# The Major Villain(s) (Primary Agent)

Have as many villains as you like. One or two is an ideal number.

  

# Factions (Secondary Agent)

This is a plot device to keep the game moving forward, regardless of what the party does. It makes the world and adventure dynamic, puts pressure on the PCs to always be taking action, and gives you ways to offer up hooks and clues as needed.

  

An example Secondary Agent would be a rival group of NPCs adventurers or a second villain.

  

# Theme

Examples themes are horror, comedy, mystery, revenge.

  

You create a theme so you can try to make all parts of your adventure resonate with this single mood or atmosphere. This makes your adventure feel like a cohesive story and a connected experience.

  

# Dramatic Question: PCs, GM

I think the best way to get a handle on this in gaming terms is to read Angry GM's post on it:

[http://theangrygm.com/how-to-build-awesome-encounters/](http://theangrygm.com/how-to-build-awesome-encounters/)

  

My take on it is, this technique helps you get into the minds of players to figure out what actions they might take and decisions they might make. If you go through this exercise for the adventure and also for each encounter, you will build a more robust adventure that anticipates the players better and is likely to be more fun as a result.

  

# The Crucible

What are the borders, boundaries, or edges of the adventure? What will limit the story.

  

A glass of water without edges is just a puddle of water. The sides and bottom of the glass - the crucible - hold the water. Likewise, we want to figure out the sides of our adventure so we know what the story is about.

  

For example, my adventure is taking place in a valley. Your might be with the PCs trapped in a dungeon. Or maybe there's a deadline before the volcano explodes. Or maybe it's the characters love for the villagers that makes them stick around and protect them.

  

# Special Conditions (Plot Overlays)

Are there any custom game mechanics, in-game situations, or special effects? An example would be magic stops working. For me, I'm thinking it's a zombie plague that grows.

  

This is a bit like the Crucible, except I feel a Crucible is about hard edges, and Special Conditions do not necessarily have to define any of the story's borders or boundaries.

  

# Background Notes

Key elements of the events that have lead up to the triggering of the adventure for the PCs. It could be a history, or just notes about how the villain's involved and how other adventure elements are involved.

  

# Key Locations (Major Locations and Sub-Locations)

An example in my adventure would be Tomar's Crossing - the PCs' home base village. From Score, I also know I need at least three dungeons. I'll also add items from my ideas and buckets list here.

  

Eventually, these Key Locations will become settings for events and encounters, and my hope for my module is some Key Locations will get used multiple times.

  

# Key NPCs (Allies, Neutrals, Minor Villains, Villain Minions)

Who can help? Who can you use as plot devices, quest givers, clue providers, merchants, and other things characters might need or want in the adventure?

  

And who might hinder? Note, it's ok to have multiple villains who aren't connected. The mad scientist in the cave might have nothing to do with the vampire plotting revenue from his prison. That said, there's nothing wrong with villains connecting during the adventure, and becoming allies 9zoiks!) or enemies the PCs can pit against each other.

  

Neutrals are opportunities. The PCs should have a chance to make friends or enemies of these people. These NPCs are the "Undecided voters" at adventure start. What the PCs do should have consequences for the regard Neutrals have for them.

# Monsters

If your adventure is going to have creatures, horrors, or aliens, list them here.

  

# Traps, Hazards, Dilemmas

Put ideas you have to make encounters interesting. Also start thinking about how NPCs and monsters will defend themselves.

  

# Treasures & Rewards

Money, magic, equipment. Gems, jewelry, and art. These are all great rewards. However, also think about how you can reward characters and players in other ways during the adventure. Remember, reward behaviour you want to get more of it.

  

# Twists, Secrets & Mysteries

List ideas here. You might write some in stone, and others are possibilities that might trigger as the adventure unfolds. Here's an article with twist design patterns you might find useful:

[http://roleplayingtips.com/campaigns/24-plot-twist-ideas/](http://roleplayingtips.com/campaigns/24-plot-twist-ideas/)

  

# Grand Finale Ideas

We cannot proscribe an ending. While an ending might be simple, likely, and obvious, we cannot assume the adventure will culminate that way, because players do unexpected things, and dice generate unexpected results.

  

So use this section to think about alternate endings to help give you ideas during your encounter design.

  

# Character Hooks & Campaign Integration

Why should the players care? What's in it for them? Key questions to answer for your campaign.

  

Also, what are possible connections between the people, places, and things in your adventure and your setting? Make as many connections as possible, as if each connection was a stitch binding two tissues so that over time the tissues grow to be one.
