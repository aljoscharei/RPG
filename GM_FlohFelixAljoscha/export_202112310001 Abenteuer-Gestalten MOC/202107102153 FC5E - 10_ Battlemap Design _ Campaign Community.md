# 10: Battlemap Design

**The Basics of Battlemap Design**
Including multiple encounters per day in adventures is a necessity for game balance. However, throwing enemies at the party to meet a quota can make combat tedious and a slog.
Especially if your adventure or dungeon does not support a wide variety of creatures.
Yet, creature variety isn’t the only way to make combat more interesting. Well-crafted battlemaps help set the scene and facilitate a higher level of engaging play for combat encounters.
**The Benefits of Battlemaps**
Battlemaps provide the table with a precise view of every element in the encounter. This includes any cover, environmental objects, enemies, allies, etc.
Thus, everyone has an equal opportunity to make tactical decisions.
By creating unique battlemaps you create new tactical opportunities each encounter. Repositioning elements of cover or adding plots of difficult terrain shake combat up.
Do this even when your pool of usable creatures is small.
Battlemaps also make it easier to use the environment to present objectives.
For instance, an area of high-ground with plentiful cover, if claimed, will make the encounter easier for the party. Yet, if the enemy claims it first, the encounter will be more difficult for the party, forcing them to waste additional resources to win the fight.
**The Elements of a Battlemap**
Let’s break-down what makes a battlemap. Each of these elements is necessary to create a battlemap for in-depth tactical play.
First, we have the environment. Think of it as the setting. The environment may change from battle to battle or it may be the same one for the entire dungeon or adventure.
The environment gives the table information on the natural effects of the environment. These effects might affect combat like how fog affects visibility.
Objects are another element. They encompass anything the party or creatures can interact with, such as:

*   E.g. rocks, wagons, or other barriers that provide defensive bonuses when behind them

*   E.g. levers or buttons that control a trap or mechanical system in the dungeon
*   E.g. weapons or improvised weapons

*   E.g. spike pits, tripwires, or poisoned dart traps

Objects create challenges for the party to overcome. They also may provide boons for the party if they are clever.
The final element is the terrain, including the elevation of it. After all, the high ground is for scouting even if it doesn’t grant mechanical benefits in combat.
Difficult terrain is also a factor as it halves a creature's movement speed when they traverse it. For example, one could use a patch of thick mud to kite the enemy around the battlefield.
Unique types of movement also fall under the difficult terrain subcategory. For example, a climbable cliff face is useful for kiting if you have a climbing speed.
**Step 1: Determine the Environment**
The environment is important to set the flavor and theme of the adventure or dungeon. It provides information that impacts combat, such as, weather, lighting, and what objects are on the battlefield.
For example, a swamp could include patches of vines to slow combatants and a fog that lowers visibility.
You don't have to determine the environment for each battlemap. It only needs to be determined when the environment changes in the adventure.
**Step 2: Map Size**
Start by asking yourself where this encounter takes place and what the goal is. This will help you determine how much space you need for the encounter.
An encounter with 2 creatures in a dungeon, for example, might only need a small battlemap. A clash with a cult in the middle of a church might require a large battlemap.
The size of your map determines how many elements will fit in the environment. The inverse is also true. The more objects and creatures needed, the larger your battlemap must be.
**Step 3: Outlining**
The next step is a two-part process, the first of which is a _Thumb Sketch,_ which is a 2"x2" box drawn on paper.
Section out parts of your _Thumb_ with blobs or words to label what goes where on the battlefield. These labels include but are not limited to the following:

*   Unit placement
*   Areas of elevation
*   Difficult terrain
*   Environmental hazards
*   Traps
*   Landmarks

Continue drafting revised _Thumbnails_ until you're satisfied with the outcome. Each _Thumbnail Sketch_ should take no longer than a couple minutes to draft.
**Canvas**
Next, move onto creating the _Canvas_ using your software of choice or pen and paper.
Draw the outline of your battlemap using the size constraints you determined. You can readjust the size as needed now.
Next, add the areas you brainstormed in your _Thumb_ and flesh them out. Keep in mind that this is not the final draft. Focus on the size and shape of each element rather than the details.
**Step 4: Build It**
The final step is to flesh-out the details of the map. Your top priority is to add plenty of objects to the battlemap.
Add at least 3 unique objects. This gives combatants a variety of interactable objects which makes combat more dynamic.
Small maps can get away with 1 or 2 different objects. This isn’t a one-size-fits-all number so take it in stride.
Leverage the environment to determine what objects fit the setting. This helps streamline your design process while providing setting information for the players.
**Step 5: Unit Placement**
Now, place your creatures around the battlefield or in the area you sectioned off in your Thumb.
The objects you’ve placed may have given your creatures a goal. For instance, an area of high ground provides a tactical advantage if captured. Your creatures will aspire to secure that from the party.
If you are creating a large map, spread your creatures out. This lessens the impact of the party’s AoE spells and abilities.
**Your goal is to give the creatures equal, if not better, access to objects compared to the party.**
In doing so, you create an encounter that has objectives other than “kill or subdue the enemy”. Your encounters become more dynamic and varied, making combat more fun.
**Step 6: Entrances and Exits**
Now it’s time to consider locations for battlefield entrances and exits. This might be irrelevant in an open landscape such as a forest, but it is a crucial step in any enclosed space.
First, determine where the party can enter the room. Depending on the map, you might have many points of entry.
Next, if permitted, place multiple exits around the battlefield. Give your creatures access to these exits so they can use them to retreat if needed.
These exits can also be entryways for reinforcements. If so, your creatures must protect these points of entry so reinforcements can join the fray.
**The Awakened Crypt

**
The map above is for a combat encounter in a crypt full of undead. The party will enter from the southern side. There they have access to coffins that provide half-cover.
The zombies hide in their stone coffins. If the party disturbs them they’ll jump out. Otherwise, they’ll emerge in 1d4 rounds.
The altar on the western side can provide three-quarters cover. It also is the point of origin for a trail of blood that leads into the northern hallway.
Mind the hidden spike trap it crosses over though!
There is an extra exit in the east. The undead can use this to retreat from combat as well.
**The Dungeon Master is Now a Dungeon Architect**
Selecting the perfect creatures and balancing your encounters is important work. Yet, the map you place them on is as impactful when designing an encounter.
By making a few Thumbs and a Canvas you'll create battlemaps full of tactical objectives in quick succession.
This outlining will reward the entire table with satisfying and dynamic combat encounters.

**Worksheet Activity - Make a Battlemap**
Seedy taverns are the lifeblood of adventures. Odd contracts, shady dealings, and valuable information are plentiful in such a location. Of course, tavern brawls are also quite common as well.
Draw up a battlemap no larger than 40x40 of a tavern with plenty of objects. Include some form of a secret entrance or exit for the barkeep/owner/crime lord to use when things go haywire!
**How To Summary**

1.  The environment dictates many elements such as weather, lighting, and types of objects.
