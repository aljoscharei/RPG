# FC5E9: Defensive Tools for Boss Encounters

**Defensive Tools for Boss Encounters**
Boss fights make an exciting finale to any adventure. The perfect boss fight should be a challenge to survive, pushing the party to their limits.
However, designing such a fight becomes difficult as the party continues to grow. For instance, debilitating crowd control can completely shut down a challenging fight.
The DM needs to account for these new powers as they plan the next boss fight. Either by tweaking creature statblocks or engaging in more strategic play.
**Let’s Make Things Interesting**
A well-tuned boss fight rides the line between “near-death experience” and “challenging fight”.
Players must use everything they have to overcome the boss. However, many higher-tier spells and features shut down the boss outright. This removes all challenge and negates counter-play.
For example, spells that paralyze or mind control a creature for many rounds.
This poses a problem. Many RAW creatures that might be suitable boss creatures don’t have the tools to withstand this crowd control.
Our goal is to add mechanics or strategies to the boss fight to ease the impact this powerful crowd control has.
**The Tactics We’ll Leverage**
**Legendary Resistance**
A prime addition to any boss creature’s statblock. Here's a summary of the mechanic found in the Monster Manual:

*   Three uses per day
*   When the creature fails a saving throw they may choose to succeed

It’s a powerful addition to any statblock. It requires nothing from the creature’s action economy. And it gives the creature 3 mulligans, preventing a series of unlucky saving throws from ruining the big boss fight.
Most RAW creatures don’t make regular use of their reaction. Ergo, defensive reactions will aid their defense while not impeding on their offense.
For reference, a Reaction is a reactive action. Each reaction has a trigger that allows the creature to choose to use their reaction.
Keep in mind that a creature only has one reaction per round. Therefore, using a defensive Reaction removes your ability to make an Opportunity Attack.
It’s also insurance for enacting your three-round combat plan to kick-off the fight.
The downside of Legendary Resistance is that it often fosters a form metagaming in combat savvy groups.
The party can unleash lesser, yet disruptive spells to use up the creature’s Legendary Resistance. Once they succeed they’ll unleash their full power without fear.
While this is metagaming, it is not harmful to the game. It’s promoting the use of strategy and tactics.
**Minions**
Minions are a fantastic solution to the issues we're trying to fix. Additional creatures help level the action economy imbalance while improving your boss’ survivability
Spellcaster minions with [Counterspell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Counterspell) can negate some of the party's powerful spells hitting the boss.
Support-oriented spellcaster minions could provide healing and buffs for the boss.
Brute-type minions can soak up damage for the boss. They can even throw down their lives for the boss, securing a retreat.
By adding minions you’ll have more pieces to play with. It also fosters smart, tactical play, such as kiting, to match the party’s strategic play.
**Environmental Hazards**
Another option that doesn't impede on RAW is to include traps and environmental hazards.
Even traps that only deal damage are helpful. After all, the more party members you down, the less damage they deal.
These hazards may also provide crowd control that prevents the party from attacking. Or battlefield control by dissuading the party from huge chunks of the battlefield.
Difficult terrain is another useful environmental hazard. Ranged attackers can use it to kite the party around the battlefield to reduce PC damage output.
**Defensive Spells**
These offer a great way to boost survivability.
For example, _[Shield](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Shield#content)_, [_Blur_](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Blur#content), and [_Mirror Image_](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mirror%20Image#content) are three low-level additions for any spell list. All three mitigate direct attacks making them all-around useful defensive options.
You can also take a page from the [_Archmage’s statblock in the SRD_](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) and have spells like [_Mage Armor,_](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mage%20Armor#content) [_Mind Blank_,](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mind%20Blank#content) and [_Stoneskin_](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Stoneskin#content) cast before combat.
All these spells elevate the caster’s base defenses. However, the real benefit is that they don’t touch the creature's action economy.

**Bolster Their Action Economy**
Increasing a boss creature's action economy is another strategy for increasing their defenses, especially for non-spellcaster bosses.
Some creatures have Parry. This allows them to use their Reaction to add their proficiency bonus to their AC against a melee attack to attempt to block it. This is an easy and flavorful ability to tack on a more martial fighter-style boss.
Another defensive addition is to add the use of the Disengage and/or Dash action as a Bonus Action. Like the rogue’s Cunning Action or the goblin’s Nimble Escape.
Keep in mind these are examples. Don't be afraid to homebrew your own unique Bonus Actions and Reactions in this regard.
**Example: Beefing up a Drider**
[Driders](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) are already solid defensive creatures thanks to their high AC and HP. Yet, there are a couple of areas I’d improve before using them as a boss creature.
For starters, I’d add Legendary Resistance. This ensures we can position the drider.
Another addition is the Skittering Swiftness trait. This would allow them to use a Dash action as a bonus action.
These traits alongside their ranged attacks, Spider Climb, and Web Walker turns the drider into the perfect kiter. The party will need to first slow this creature down before they can defeat it.
**Time to Tinker**
There’s no worse feeling than bad rolls ruining a climactic boss fight. By bolstering boss defenses you can prevent this from happening.
Adding minions and environmental hazards boost your boss’ action economy. They can also reduce the party’s damage output.
Direct changes to the boss's statblock such as adding Legendary Resistance will also improve their defenses.
A few defensive additions to your boss fight will go a long way in solidifying its challenge.

**Worksheet Activity - Master the Minotaur**
The minotaur is a terrifying creature due to its high-powered offense. However, its defenses are much to be desired. Using the tips from this lesson, prop up the minotaur’s defenses for a boss battle against a low-level party.
What is a better location for a clash with a minotaur than a labyrinth? Feel free to use and edit the included map for this activity.
