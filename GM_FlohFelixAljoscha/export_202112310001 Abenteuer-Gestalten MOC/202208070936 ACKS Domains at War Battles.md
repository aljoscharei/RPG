# Basic Rules
This chapter introduces the basic rules of Domains at War: Battles. It includes only what’s necessary to fight a straightforward battle between two forces on open plains or fields without heroes (p. 40) or terrain (p. 29).

## CORE CONCEPTS


### SIDES, ARMIES, DIVISIONS, AND UNITS

A battle is fought between two sides. Each side may consist of one or more players. All of the forces controlled by one side during a battle are referred to as that side’s army.

Each army is made up of several divisions. An army typically has three to eight divisions. In a multi-player battle, each player will usually control one or more divisions.

Each division is itself made up of one or more units. A division typically has three to eight units. In the basic game, units are at company scale. A company-scale unit is usually made up of a group of human, demi-human, or beastman troops, numbering 120 infantry or 60 cavalry, although units of e.g. skeletons, harpies, wyverns, or even dragons are also possible. Whatever its make-up, each unit is represented on the tabletop with a unit counter (p. 12). An assortment of unit counters, scaled for use with 2" hexes (see below), is included with the Complete Domains at War Set.

You can use 15mm or 25mm ancient/fantasy miniatures instead of unit counters if you don’t have the Complete Domains at War Set or just prefer the aesthetics of miniatures. Below are the recommended base sizes and the number of figures per base in each scale. These are compatible with the most common miniature basing schemes in each scale.

A typical Domains at War army will have 10 to 25 units, representing a force of around 600 to 3,000 combatants. This is a perfectly sized army for war- mongering barons, earls, counts, and dukes. However, some scenarios or battles fought in the context of an ongoing RPG campaign (campaign battles) will feature far larger armies. For battles with less than 600 or more than 3,000 combatants on a side, refer to Chapter 6, Scale.

### OFFICERS

An officer is an important character taking part in the battle. In a campaign game, officers are usually PCs and major NPCs and monsters. In a battle fought outside of an RPG campaign (a  standalone scenario), the scenario itself will specify the officers involved.

Each officer is represented on the battlefield with an officer counter. An assortment of 1" x 1" officer counters is included with the Complete Domains at War Set, but you can substitute fantasy miniatures or other playing pieces as desired. Officers are rated with various officer characteristics (p. 14), the most important of which is leadership ability (p. 14).

Officers are divided into three types: generals, commanders, and lieutenants. Generals are officers in charge of armies; an army can be thought of as a group of divisions under one general. The maximum number of divisions in an army is limited by its general’s leadership ability.

Commanders are officers in charge of divisions; a division can be thought of as a group of units under one commander. Each army’s general will always serve as one division’s commander, while other officers will command the remaining divisions in the army. The maximum number of units in a division that can move and fight is determined by its commander’s leadership ability.

Lieutenants are officers in charge of individual units. Lieutenants increase their unit’s morale (p. 13), make the unit easier to control, and can replace division commanders lost in battle. While an army must include a general and commanders, it might or might not have any lieutenants. An exceptionally well-trained and organized army, such as the historical Roman legion, might have a lieutenant leading each unit, while a barbarian warband might have no lieutenants at all. When lieutenants are present in an army, each one will be assigned to a different unit.

In the basic rules, officers do not personally move, fight, or use magic. Chapter 4, Heroes, offers advanced rules for handling heroic officers.

### BATTLEMAPS AND HEXES

The units and officers of the opposing armies move and fight on a battlemap representing the region of the battlefield. The battlemap is a paper or game-board surface divided into six-sided hexes. Each hex represents an area of ground measuring 60' across. The hexes on the battlemap serve to regulate the movement and combat of units.

A 4' x 3' fold-out battlemap, **24 hexes wide and 18 hexes deep**, is included with the Complete Domains at War Set. It is designed to the same scale as our unit and commander counters, and features 2" wide hexes.



Important Note: 
If you are using miniatures instead of unit counters (p. 12), you may find you need to use a battlemap with larger hexes. 15mm figures work well on 2" hexes, but for 25mm figures we recommend 4" hexes. Kallistra’s Hexon line of 4" terrain hexes is a great choice for building a Domains at War: Battles battlemap in 25mm. Ultimately, hexes of any available size will work as long as the playing pieces used can fit inside the hexes, but Domains at War looks and plays better if the physical size of the hexes and the counters correlate with each other.

--> Table Basing
![[Domains at ware Miniature Scales.png]]


When fighting battles with lots of units, we recommend using multiple battlemaps. This will ensure that the armies have sufficient frontage to maneuver. For battles with 30 or more units on a side, use two adjacent battlemaps to create a battlefield that is 8' x 3' (48 hexes wide and 18 hexes deep). Add an additional battlemap for every 30 units on a side. Additional battlemaps can be created by hand, ordered from Autarch, or printed using the Complete Domains at War Set pdf.

If desired, terrain pieces (p. 29) such as hills, streams, groves of forest, patches of mud, and other geographical features can be placed on the battlemap. See Chapter 2, Terrain, for an explanation of placement and effects of terrain.

### SEQUENCE OF PLAY

In Domains at War, battles are fought in a series of **combat rounds of 10 seconds each**. Each round begins with an initiative phase during which each commander rolls initiative for his division.

Starting with the commander with highest initiative, each commander then receives a command phase during which he receives a number of activation points (AP) equal to his leadership ability (p. 14). The commander then spends his AP to activate the units of his division. Units are activated one at a time, each taking a movement sequence (p. 18) followed by an attack sequence (p. 20) when activated. The commander chooses the exact order in which to activate his division’s units, as well as the exact nature of each unit’s actions. Once the commander has spent all of his AP, his command phase ends and the next commander’s command phase begins.

After all command phases have been resolved, a morale phase (p. 25) is held, during which the morale of each army is assessed. Play then proceeds to the next combat round, continuing until all units on one side have been destroyed, routed (p. 23), or voluntarily exited the battlefield

(p. 19).

## UNITS

Now that we’ve gone over the basics, let’s look at units more closely. We noted earlier that units represent companies of around 120 infantry or 60 cavalry. More specifically, units can consist of up to 120 man-sized creatures; 60 large-sized creatures such as ogres; 60 man- sized riders seated on large-sized mounts, such as human heavy cavalry; 20 huge creatures, such as hill giants; 5 gigantic creatures, such as elephants; or even 1 colossal creature, such as a giant roc. Such a large body of creatures takes up a substantial amount of space; each

unit is assumed to be approximately 60' wide and 36' deep. Each unit is represented with a unit counter on the battlemap. Since each 2" hex represents 60' of ground, the unit counters are 2" wide and 1.16" deep.

### UNIT CHARACTERISTICS

Units are defined by the following characteristics.

- Unit Type: Unit Type is a general designator of the unit’s size, training and equipment. Unit Type is presented in the following format: 
	[number] [race, if non-human] [veteran status, if veterans] [unit type]
	- Unit Formation: Unit Formation determines what sort of tactics and maneuvers the unit is capable of. The unit formations are Irregular Foot (IF), Loose Foot (LF), Formed Foot (FF), Irregular Mounted (IM), Loose Mounted (LM), Formed Mounted (FM), Flyer (FLY), and War Machinery (WM). Each of these is briefly described below.
	- **Irregular Foot**: Irregular Foot are poorly-trained and undisciplined bands of warriors. They are incapable of any advanced tactics and must rely on individual ferocity or sheer mass. Historical examples of Irregular Foot troops include Persian militia, medieval peasant levies, and Viking berserkers. Fantasy examples include beastmen and mindless undead.
	- **Loose Foot**: Loose Foot are well-trained soldiers fighting in open order, with a frontage of one soldier every 5' to 6'. Their extended formation allows them to easily pass through or around obstacles or friendly units, and to withdraw in the face of enemy missiles or heavy troops. Conversely, they are ill- suited to holding ground or fighting in close combat. Historical examples of Loose Foot troops include Hellenic peltasts, Roman velites, and other javelineers, slingers, and bowmen of antiquity.
	- **Formed Foot**: Formed Foot are highly-disciplined soldiers fighting shoulder-to-shoulder in close order, with a frontage of one soldier every 3'. Formed Foot are sturdy defenders, usually heavily armed and armored. They are used to take or hold ground in close combat. Historical examples of Formed Foot troops include Hellenic hoplites, Macedonian phalangites, Roman legionaries, medieval men-at-arms, and other heavy infantry.
	- **Irregular Mounted**: Irregular Mounted include poorly-trained and undisciplined cavalry, riders of particularly aggressive, unpredictable, or vicious mounts, and packs of war beasts or trained monsters (whether they carry riders or not). Historical examples of Irregular Mounted troops include Assyrian war dogs, Arabian camel riders, and Hellenistic war elephants. Fantasy examples include goblin wolf riders and worg packs.
	- **Loose Mounted**: Loose Mounted include well-trained cavalry mounted on light warhorses fighting in an extended order. A frontage of one horse per 6' to 8' is typical. Generally equipped with bows, javelins, or other missile weapons, Loose Mounted units use their speed and mobility to harass and disorder enemy forces. Historical examples of Loose Mounted include Scythian, Hun, and Mongol horse archers, as well as Roman auxiliary cavalry, and Numidian and Persian light cavalry. Missile-armed charioteers, such as those of the New Kingdom Egyptians, also function as Loose Mounted.
	- **Formed Mounted**: Formed Mounted are highly-disciplined cavalry mounted on medium or heavy warhorses fighting in close order (knee to knee). A frontage of one horse per 4' is typical. Formed Mounted are generally shock troops equipped with lances, but some (cataphracts) may carry and use composite bows, which they use to disorder their foes before finishing them off with a charge. Historical examples of Formed Mounted troops include Macedonian Companion cavalry, Parthian and Byzantine cataphracts, and medieval knights. Spear-armed charioteers, such as those of the Hittites, also function as Formed Mounted.
	- **Flyer**: Flyers are aerial monsters or cavalry. Flyers generally fly wingtip-to-wingtip in order to maximize striking power, with as few as 5 and as many as 60 in a unit depending on size. Some flyers carry riders equipped with lances or bows and serve as highly mobile cataphracts. Other flyers rely on beak and talon. Fantasy examples include dragon riders, giant eagles, griffin knights, and wyverns. Historical examples are sadly absent.
	- **War Machinery**: War Machinery includes all crew-served pieces of artillery and siege equipment. War Machinery crews are only light equipped with hand weapons, with the real value being the machine itself. Historical examples of War Machinery includes ballistas, catapults, trebuchets, battering rams, and siege towers (p. 57 – p. 62).
- Unit Movement Rate: Unit Movement Rate determines how many hexes the unit can move per round. Each unit has three separate movement rates: marching (p. 18), hustling (p. 18), and charging (p. 19). These are presented in the format marching rate / hustling rate / charging rate.
	- Formed Foot typically have a movement rate of 1/2/3,
	- Loose Foot typically are 2/4/6, 
	- Formed Mounted typically 3/6/9, and 
	- Loose Mounted 4/8/12.
	- Irregular Foot and Mounted movement rates can vary widely.
- Unit Armor Class (Unit AC): Unit Armor Class is a measure of how hard the unit is to damage. Unit AC ranges from 0 to 10 or more. Most light units will have an AC of 0-3, while heavier troops will have a Unit AC of 4-7.
- Unit Hit Dice (Unit HD): Unit Hit Dice measure the unit’s fighting power. Most units have around 1 Unit HD.
- Unit Hit Points (uhp): Unit Hit Points measure the unit’s resilience in the face of combat. Most units have 4-8 uhp. **Each uhp in Domains at War: Battles represents about 70 hp in ACKS**. A unit is destroyed and removed from battle if its uhp are reduced to 0.
- Unit Attack: Unit Attack indicates how often and accurately a unit may attack with a particular method. Unit Attack is presented in the following format: [number of attacks] [method of attack] [attack throw].
- Number of Attacks: Number of attacks is how many attacks the unit may make during its attack sequence. Most units receive one to three attacks during their attack sequences. Some units attack less than once per combat round. If so, the number of attacks will be listed as a fraction. For instance, if number of attacks is 1/3, the unit may attack only once every three combat rounds.
- Method of Attack: The method of attack might be a weapon (e.g. longbow), fighting style (e.g. weapon and shield) or attack routine (e.g. claw/bite). If a unit has multiple methods of attack, it will have a separate Unit Attack characteristic for its primary and secondary methods.
- Attack Throw: The number listed is the target value required to hit an AC of 0 on a roll of 1d20. Any successful attack will inflict 1 point of damage. There is no separate “damage roll” in Domains at War: Battles because each attack throw actually represents the outcome of dozens of attacks. Units with the potential to do more than 50 points of damage in a combat round are given additional attacks.
	- Certain types of troops (e.g. heavy cavalry) are **eligible for special bonus attacks whenever they charge**. If so, the attack characteristics of the bonus attacks will be noted on the unit’s roster beneath its melee attack, in the format Charge: [number of attacks] [method of attack] [attack throw]
- Unit Morale: Unit Morale measures how likely the unit is to retreat (p. 23) when it takes casualties. It ranges from -6 to +4, with most units having morale scores of between -1 to +1. Certain units (such as clerical followers) may have much higher morale. Unit Morale modifies **shock rolls** (made when the unit loses 50% or more of its uhp) **and morale rolls** (made when the army loses its general or 33% or more of its starting units). Note that if you are using Domains at War: Campaigns, Unit Morale would also modify loyalty rolls made when the unit suffers a calamity.

### UNIT CONDITIONS

Conditions are circumstances that modify the characteristics or available actions of a unit. Conditions are marked with tokens. When the token is removed, the condition ends, and vice versa. The following conditions are referenced throughout the rules:

- **Damaged**: Damage to a unit is marked by placing one or more damage tokens on the unit. A unit is destroyed and removed from the battle when it has taken damage equal to its unit hit points. Damage tokens are not normally removed, but rather accumulate until the unit is destroyed.
- **Depleted**: A depleted token indicates the unit is depleting its store of arrows, bolts, stones, or thrown weapons. Each depleted token reduces the unit’s number of attacks per attack sequence when using that weapon by one. Depleted tokens are not normally removed.
- **Disordered**:Adisorderedunithashaditsformation disrupted by rapid movement, casualties, etc. A unit becomes disordered if it charges, withdraws, or takes damage. Disordered units suffer a -2 penalty to their Unit AC, shock rolls, and morale rolls, and cost 1 additional activation point to activate. A disordered unit is marked by placing a disordered token on it. The disordered token is removed the next time the unit is activated.
- **Ready**: A ready unit may make a reaction attack (see p. 21) on enemy units that target it or its adjacent allies. A ready unit is marked by placing a ready token on it. The ready token is removed if the unit moves, attacks, or becomes disordered.
- **Shielded**: A shielded unit has adopted a defensive formation such as a shield wall, testudo, or hedgehog. Shielded units are marked by placing a shielded token on the unit. While the shielded token is present, its Unit AC is increased by +2 versus melee and thrown attacks and +4 versus bow, crossbow, and sling attacks. It receives a +2 bonus on morale rolls. The shielded token is removed if the unit attacks, moves, or becomes disordered.

An assortment of 1" condition tokens is included with the Complete Domains at War Set. When playing with miniatures, we recommend making a set of custom tokens in the same scale as your figures (15mm or 25mm). 
For damage tokens, use a single-figure base mounted with blood-soaked bodies (one per point of damage). 
For depleted tokens, use a single-figure base with a pile of dropped bows. 
For disordered tokens, try a single-figure base with piles of dropped weapons and shields. 
Ready tokens can be represented using a standard and emblem mounted on a single-figure base, while 
shielded tokens can be made with a row of upright shields on a double-figure base. If you don’t have counters, you can just jot down the condition of units on a piece of scratch paper.

### UNIT FACING

On the battlemap, each unit occupies one hex and faces one of that hex’s six vertices. The two hexes in front of the unit’s current hex are called its front hexes. The hexes to the left and right of the unit’s current hex are its flank hexes. The two hexes to the rear of the unit’s current hex are its rear hexes.


![[Bildschirmfoto 2022-08-15 um 16.25.46.png]]

A unit’s facing impacts its ability to move and fight on the battlemap:

-   -  A unit which is hustling or charging is restricted to moving forward into its front hexes (see p. 18).
-   -  A unit entering the front hexes of an enemy unit becomes threatened by that unit (see p. 19). Once threatened, a unit’s activities become highly restricted.
-   -  A unit can only make melee attacks against enemies in its front hexes (which is to say, against enemies it is threatening).
-   -  A unit that is attacked from its flank or rear hexes is subject to penalties to AC and morale.
    
    See Movement Sequence (p. 18) and Attack Sequence (p. 20) for additional details on the impact of unit facing.
### ORGANIZATION OF UNITS INTO DIVISIONS
    
All of an army’s units must be organized into divisions. (Remember, a division is simply a group of units under one commander.) An army might have just one division, to which all of its units belong, but it will likely have several divisions. The maximum number of divisions permitted to the army is equal to its general’s leadership ability (see below).
    
Each division must include at least one unit. There is no maximum limit to the number of units in a division, but large divisions are harder to control. Most generals aim to have three to eight divisions of three to eight units each in their armies.
    
In a one-off scenario, the scenario designer will specify how each side’s units are organized into divisions. In a campaign battle, the players controlling the armies will divide the units of the armies into divisions based on their general’s leadership and the available commanders. A lack of suitable commanders might prevent an army from having an optimal number of divisions.
    
 Wise generals will make sure their divisions incorporate units with a variety of weapons but similar movement rates. For instance, putting heavy infantry and bowmen together into a division would work well, but putting heavy infantry and light horse into a division together would not, because of the vast difference in movement rates.

## OFFICERS

Now let’s take a closer look at officers, the most important characters on the battlefield. As explained under Core Concepts, there are three types of officers: generals, commanders, and lieutenants. In a standalone scenario, the scenario designer will select the generals, commanders, and lieutenants participating in the battle.

In a campaign battle, the officers are usually PCs and/or major NPCs and monsters drawn from the campaign. However, not every character can serve as an officer:

-  A PC or NPC must be at least7th level to serve as a general or commander in a campaign battle, while a monster must have at least four or more Hit Dice than is average for the creatures it commands.
- A PC or NPC must be of at least 5th level to serve as a lieutenant in a campaign battle, while a monster must have at least two more Hit Dice than average for the creatures it commands.
- A beastman chieftain can always serve as a commander for units of its own race, regardless of its HD. Likewise, a beastman sub-chieftain can always serve as a lieutenant for a unit of its race.
    
    The officer requirements may be waived by the Judge if he feels a particular PC, NPC, or monster is in a position to command units despite not meeting these qualifications.
    
    ### OFFICER CHARACTERISTICS
    
    All officers posses four officer characteristics: leadership ability, zone of control, strategic ability, and morale modifier. In a standalone scenario, the scenario designer will assign the officer characteristics of the generals, commanders, and lieutenants participating in the battle based on his design. In a campaign battle, these characteristics will be derived from the ACKS ability scores and proficiencies of the characters, as explained in Domains at War: Campaigns, p. 20.
- ##### Leadership Ability: 
	- This rates the character’s capability to give orders and have them obeyed. Leadership ability determines the number of activation points (AP) that a commander receives. It also determines the number of divisions a general may have in his army. Leadership ability ranges from 1 to 8.
- ##### Zone of Control (ZOC): 
	- This is the radius, in hexes, within which a commander may activate units in his division without penalty. ZOC is always equal to one-half the commander’s leadership ability, rounded up. ZOC is measured by counting the number of hexes from the commander’s hex to the unit in question (excluding the commander’s hex, but including the hex of the unit to be ordered).
- ##### Strategic Ability:
	- This rates the character’s military puissance and effectiveness. Strategic ability modifies an officer’s initiative roll each combat round. (Strategic ability also plays a significant role in certain mechanics in Domains at War: Campaigns.) Strategic ability ranges from -3 to +6.
- ##### Morale Modifier: 
	- This is the character’s ability to inspire loyalty and courage. A general’s morale modifier modifies the morale rolls of every unit in his army. A commander or lieutenant’s morale modifier modifies the shock rolls and morale rolls of the unit he is attached to. Morale modifier ranges from -3 to +7.

### OFFICERS ON THE BATTLEMAP

Each officer is represented on the battlemap with an officer counter. At the start of the battle, the general and each other commander must be attached to one of the units in their respective divisions. Each lieutenant’s counter must be attached to whichever unit he is in charge of. Place the officer’s counter on the unit’s counter to indicate he is attached to that unit.

During the battle, officers move with the unit they are attached to. They do not move or attack independent of their unit, and do not directly affect combat. (For rules allowing officers to move and attack independent of units, see Chapter 4, Heroes).

### FUNCTIONS OF OFFICERS

Each type of officer has a particular function in Domains at War: Battles. The functions of each type are summarized below.

- Commanders: Commanders lead divisions, ordering their units to move and fight on the battlefield. The quantity and quality of an army’s commanders is central to its command and control. Their functions are:
	-  The commander’s initiative score (p. 17), modified by his strategic ability, determines when the units of his division may act.
	-  On his initiative number, each commander gets a command phase during which he spends his activation points (AP) to activate the units of his division. A commander receives a number of AP equal to his leadership ability. Thus, the commander’s leadership ability determines how many of his division’s units are able to act each round.
    - The commander’s morale modifier modifies the shock rolls and morale rolls of the unit he is attached to.
- Generals: Generals leads armies. A skilled general can maintain control of a large and complex army, and keep its troops fighting despite heavy casualties and setbacks. The general’s importance is reflected in the following mechanics:
    -  The general’s leadership ability determines the maximum number of divisions permitted in the army.
	-  The general’s morale modifier modifies the morale rolls of every unit in his army.
	-  The general may appoint new commanders to replace those lost during a battle
	-  The general has all the functions of a division commander
	- In an ongoing campaign, the army general has even more functions. See Domains at War: Campaigns for more information on the role of the army general in strategic initiative, reconnaissance, and other operations.
	- In campaign battles, the loss of an army general should count as a calamity that triggers a roll on the Mercenary Loyalty table for each mercenary officer. This may result in some of the mercenary officers deserting to the opposing side or fleeing the battlefield. Divisions and/or units under the command of the mercenary officer will generally obey the officer. See Domains at War: Campaigns for more information on mercenary officers and mercenary loyalty.

- Lieutenants: Lieutenants lead units. The presence of many lieutenants is the mark of a highly trained legion rather than a disorganized warband. Units with lieutenants are more capable of surviving the chaos of battle and carrying out long-range missions beyond their commander’s zone of control. Rather than receive command phases and activate units, they perform the following functions:
	-  The lieutenant reduces the cost to activate his unitby one AP (to a minimum of one).
	-  The lieutenant’s morale modifier is added to the morale rolls and shock rolls of the unit he is attached to.
	-  Ifacommanderislost,alieutenantmaybepromoted to take command of his division.
See Sequence of Play (p. 17), Initiative Phase (p. 17), Command Phase (p. 18), and Morale Phase (p. 25) for more details.
    
LOSS OF AN OFFICER
    
If an officer’s unit is destroyed or routed (p. 23), the officer is lost. He is assumed to be killed if the unit was destroyed, and captured if the unit was routed. (If using the Heroic Character rules in Chapter 4, an officer might survive the destruction or rout of his unit.)
    
 If the lost officer was a division commander, none of the units of his division can be activated until the lost commander is replaced. A lost commander may be replaced by the army’s general at the start of the next combat round.
    
The general has two ways to replace a commander:
    
-  Any existing commander may be assigned the former commander’s units. The units are simply added to their new commander’s division and may be activated in his upcoming command phase. (This can create large, unwieldy divisions, of course.)
-  A lieutenant from a unit in the division that lost its commander may be promoted to become that division’s commander. In this way, lower level PCs and NPCs can have command thrust upon them. The newly appointed commander rolls for initiative in the initiative phase of that round, and may begin activating the newly-assigned units in his subsequent command phase.


IMPORTATANT NOTE
_It normally costs one AP to activate a unit from the commander’s division, but if the unit is disordered or out of its commander’s zone of control this cost is increased. It is therefore a good idea to make sure each commander has a leadership ability at least equal to the number of units in his division. Otherwise he will not be able to activate all of his units during his command phase.__

_It is often helpful for the commander’s leadership ability to be higher than the number of units in his division, so that he can activate all of his units even if they become disordered or go outside his zone of control. This requirement can be mitigated if the units of the division are led by lieutenants._


If the lost officer was the army general, his loss will trigger a morale roll by every unit of the army during the subsequent morale phase of that round. See Morale (p. 25) for a further discussion. If the army does not rout, the commander with the next highest leadership ability becomes

the new army general at the start of the next combat round. If one or more commander’s leadership ability scores are tied, resolve the tie in favor of the commanders’ strategic ability scores. If the results are still tied, roll randomly to break the tie.

If an army is so unfortunate as to lose both its general and one or more commanders during a combat round, first determine which commander becomes the new general, then allow the new general to appoint any new commanders. If an army loses all of its commanders and has no lieutenants to replace them, none of its units can be activated, and it will probably be routed or destroyed very quickly.

## SET UP

In the basic rules, we assume that the opposing armies are meeting each other face-to-face for a straightforward battle. Set-up for the more complex strategic situations that might arise under the Domains at War: Campaigns rules is explained in Chapter 3, Strategic Situations. For now, read on.

### DEPLOYMENT ZONES

At the start of a battle, each army deploys (sets up) its units within a deployment zone on the battlemap. Each deployment zone is divided into five areas: Center, Left Flank, Right Flank,

Left Wing, and Right Wing.

The Deployment Zone illustration below shows the five areas of the deployment zone for opposing armies “A” and “B”. Note that A’s Left Wing is equivalent to B’s Right Wing, and vice versa.

Deployment Restrictions
When being set up, units  must obey the deployment restrictions noted below:



- No more than one unit may be deployed in any hex. Units may only be set up in whole hexes, not in half- hexes on the edge of the battlemap or deployment zone. However, whole hexes which overlap two deployment areas, such as between the Left Wing and Left Flank, are considered to be part of both deployment areas.
- **Formed Foot may not be deployed in the Flank areas.**
- **Foot units and Formed Mounted units may not be deployed in the Wing areas.**

![[Bildschirmfoto 2022-08-15 um 16.30.50.png]]


## ORDER OF DEPLOYMENT

Unless special circumstances dictate otherwise, each side deploys its units simultaneously and in secret. Place a screen on the battlemap between the two sides. Both armies then reveal their deployment at the start of the first combat round.

### DEPLOYING INTO PHALANX

Under certain circumstances, a commander can merge two Formed Foot units to form one Phalanx unit. In order to be merged into a Phalanx, both Formed Foot units must belong to the commander’s division and both must be identically equipped with spears or polearms. Once merged, the unit characteristics of the Phalanx unit are identical to those of its constituent units, except as follows:

-  The Phalanx unit’s uhp are equal to the sum of its two constituent units’ uhp.
-  The Phalanx unit’s AC is equal to the average of its two constituent unit’s AC
-  ThePhalanx unit’s number of attacks are equal to the sum of its two constituent unit’s number of attacks.
-  The Phalanx unit cannot charge. -  The Phalanx unit’s morale score is increasedby 1.
- A Phalanx unit is treated as one unit for purposes of activation, but if destroyed or routed counts as the loss of both units. Deployment as a Phalanx is permanent for the duration of the battle. Phalanx units are otherwise normal Formed Foot units. To represent a Phalanx on the battlefield, stack two unit counters on top of each other, or place the miniatures in two ranks.

## SEQUENCE OF PLAY

Battles are fought in a series of combat rounds. Each round begins with an initiative phase during which each commander rolls initiative.

Starting with the commander with highest initiative, each commander takes a command phase. When it is a commander’s command phase, the commander is said to be active. When a commander becomes active, he receives a number of activation points (AP) equal to his leadership ability. The commander spends these AP to activate the units of his division.

Units are activated one at a time, each taking a movement sequence (p. 18) followed by an attack sequence (p. 20) when activated. The active commander chooses the exact order in which to activate his division’s units, as well as the exact nature of each unit’s actions.

When the outcome of the active commander’s command phase is fully resolved, his command phase ends and the next commander’s command phase begins. After all command phases have been resolved, a morale phase (p. 25) is held, during which the morale of each army is assessed. Play then proceeds to the next combat round, continuing until all units on one side have been destroyed, routed (p. 23), or voluntarily exited from the battlefield (p. 19).

--> Sequence of Play
![[Domains at war sequence of Play.png]]

## INITIATIVE PHASE

During the initiative phase of each combat round, each commander calculates his initiative score by rolling 1d6 and adding his strategic ability. Starting with the commander with the highest initiative score and counting downward from there, each commander takes his command phase in turn.

TIE BREAKING

If one or more commanders have equal initiative scores, resolve the tie in order of the commanders’ strategic ability score. If the commanders’ strategic ability scores are tied, resolve the tie randomly.

DELAYING

If desired, a commander can choose to delay his command phase until later in the round. If a commander states that he is delaying his command phase, he can take his phase at any later initiative score, down to the negative value of his initiative score. A delaying commander must take his command phase by the time the initiative count reaches the negative value of his initiative score.

A delaying commander can begin his command phase immediately before or immediately after another commander’s phase, but cannot interrupt a command phase once it has begun. If two commanders are both trying to simultaneously take their initiative, the commander with the higher initiative score dictates who goes first.
## COMMAND PHASE

When it is a commander’s command phase, the commander is said to be active. When he becomes active, the commander receives a number of activation points (AP) equal to his leadership ability. He spends these AP to activate units from his division.

It takes one AP to activate a unit. If the unit is outside of the commander’s zone of control, the cost to activate the unit is increased by one. If the unit is disordered, the cost to activate it is increased by one. If a unit is both disordered and out of its commander’s zone of control, the cost to activate it is increased by two.

![[Domains at war unit activation costs.png]]
- Actvate Unit in Division cost. minimum 1 AP
	- Unit is outside of comander's zone of control +1 AP
	- Unit is disordered +1 AP
	- Unit is led by lieutentant -1 AP minimum cost of activation is 1 AP
	- Unit has a commander attached -1 AP minimum cost of activation is 1 AP



If a lieutenant is leading the unit, the cost to activate the lieutenant’s unit is decreased by one. If the commander himself is attached to the unit, the cost to activate the unit is decreased by one. The cost cannot be reduced to zero.

Units are activated one at a time. When activated, a unit becomes the active unit. The unit’s disordered token, if any, is removed when it is activated. The active unit first takes a movement sequence (see below) and then takes an attack sequence (p. 20). The active commander chooses the exact order in which to activate his division’s units. Each unit’s activation must be completed before the next unit’s activation is begun; a unit’s movement sequence and attack sequence may not be “split up” between two activations or “saved” for later use in the same commander phase. A unit may not be activated more than once each combat round.

A commander might not have enough AP to activate all of his units. An AP shortage might occur if the commander’s division has more units than his leadership ability, if the units are outside of his zone of control, or if many of the units are disordered. Units which are not activated do not move or attack during their division’s command phase. Unactivated units are assumed to be awaiting orders, catching their breath, trading insults and battle cries with nearby foes, bandaging wounds, and otherwise doing anything but risking life and limb.

A commander does not have to spend all of his AP (and sometimes may not be able to), but any unspent AP are lost at the end of the command phase.

## MOVEMENT SEQUENCE

During its movement sequence, the active unit may stand fast, march, hustle, or charge. The unit’s commander determines its exact movement.
- **Stand Fast**: A unit standing fast remains stationary, e.g. it does not move or change facing. During its attack sequence (p. 20), a stationary unit can attack with melee weapons, attack with missile weapons, defend (p. 24), or ready to attack (p. 25).
 ^775698
- **March**: A marching unit can move a number of hexes up to its marching movement rate. The unit can move in any direction regardless of facing, and can change its facing at no cost before, during, and/or while marching. During its attack sequence, a marching unit can attack with melee weapons, attack with most missile weapons, defend, or ready to attack.
 ^bf4b88
- **Hustle**: A hustling unit can change its facing in any direction prior to moving, and then move a number of hexes up to its hustling movement rate. Each hex of movement must be into one of its front hexes. The unit can change its facing while hustling, but each 60-degree facing change counts as one hex of movement. A hustling unit cannot take an attack sequence.
 ^4bce24
- **Charge**: A charging unit can move a number of hexes up to its charging movement rate. Each hex of movement must be into one of the unit’s front hexes. The unit cannot change its facing before, during, or while charging. A unit which charges immediately becomes disordered. During its attack sequence, a charging unit can attack with melee weapons. However, a charging unit does not have to attack; a unit can charge simply to move across the battlemap quickly if desired. ^c900c9

![[Domains at war movement options.png]]

### GENERAL MOVEMENT RULES

All movement is governed by the following general rules:

- Units can only move into whole hexes. Half-hexes on the edge of a battlemap are considered to be impassable.
- Units can move outside of the commander’s zone of control if desired. However, the units will cost one additional AP to activate next combat round if they are still outside of the commander’s zone of control.
- Units cannot normally move through other units, or end their movement in the same hex as another unit. However, Loose Foot, Loose Mounted, and Flyers can march or hustle through friendly units, and be marched or hustled through by friendly units.
- Units may not move through two consecutive hexes that are adjacent to enemy units.
- Units can voluntarily exit the battlemap along their own map edge. Units which voluntarily exit are removed from play and may not return during the battle.
- Terrain (p. 29) may impact the movement of some units.

Outside of the movement sequence, a unit may also choose, or be forced, to move as a result of combat. See Withdrawals (p. 22) and Retreats (p. 23).

### THREATENING
- When a unit occupies either of the two front hexes of an enemy unit, it is said to be threatened by the enemy unit. The enemy unit is, conversely, said to be threatening it
- A Flyer unit can only be threatened by an enemy Flyer or by an enemy unit conducting a reaction attack (p. 21) against the Flyer.
- If a unit becomes threatened while moving (usually by entering an enemy unit’s front hexes), its move immediately ends. 

#### Disengage
- If a unit starts its movement sequence threatened, it cannot move during its movement sequence, other than to change facing towards a threatening enemy, unless it first disengages [[202208070936 ACKS Domains at War Battles#disengagement]]
	- To conduct a disengagement, the unit’s commander announces that the unit is disengaging. The disengagement triggers one free melee attack sequence (see below) from each threatening enemy unit which is not disordered. However, a disengaging Loose Foot, Loose Mounted, or Flyer unit does not trigger attacks by threatening units that have a slower marching movement rate than it.
	- If an attack sequence is triggered by disengagement, the attacker applies a special +2 bonus to hit the disengaging unit. If multiple attack sequences are triggered, the disengaging unit chooses the order in which the threatening units’ attack sequences are resolved.
	- Assuming the disengaging unit is not eliminated by the disengagement attack sequence(s), it may then conduct a marching movement. The first hex into which the disengaging unit moves must not be a threatened hex and must not be adjacent to any of the enemy unit(s) which had threatened it. A unit which cannot move into any such hexes may not disengage.
	- Irregular Foot and Irregular Mounted units may not disengage, due to lack of discipline. War Machinery units may not disengage due to inability to maneuver.


## ATTACK SEQUENCE

After completing its movement sequence, the active unit may conduct an attack sequence (unless it hustled). A unit can only conduct one attack sequence per activation. Most attack sequences consist of multiple attacks, however. A Formed or Loose unit does not have to conduct an attack sequence, but an Irregular unit must attack if able.

### STEPS OF AN ATTACK SEQUENCE

A unit’s attack sequence is resolved by following the steps listed below:

1. Declare Method of Attack  
2. Declare Target  
3. Resolve Reaction Attack Sequence 
4. Check for Flanking  
5. Make Attack Throws  
6. Deal Damage  
7. Determine Degree of Shock

### DECLARE METHOD OF ATTACK

There are two basic methods of attack: melee and missile. Some units may have one method of attack, others may have one attack of each method, and some may have several different methods of each type. A unit capable of different methods of attack may only utilize one method of attack in any given attack sequence, however.

- A unit may only declare a melee attack if it meets the following criteria:
	-  The attacker must not have hustled or disengaged during its movement sequence.
    -  The attacker must be threatening one or more enemy units.

- A unit may only declare a missile attack if it meets the following criteria:
    -  If using arbalest or crossbows, the attacker must have stood fast during its movement sequence. Otherwise, the attacker must have either stood fast or marched during its movement sequence. Units that hustled or charged during their movement sequence may never declare missile attacks.
-  The attacker must not be threatened by any enemy units. Threatened units may not conduct missile attacks.
    
    The unit’s attack characteristics will determine the number of attacks it will receive during the attack sequence. The number of attacks may vary depending on the method of attack.
    
    #### Charge: 
   -  If the attacker charged during its movement sequence, its melee attack will be a charge. Charging grants a **+2 bonus** to attack throws. Flyer, Formed Foot, and any Mounted units, if equipped with spears, polearms, or lances, deal one extra point of damage during charges if they hit with at least one attack with these weapons. **Formed and Irregular Mounted units also receive bonus attacks when they charge**, based on the mount’s attack characteristics. A unit that makes a charge attack always becomes disordered if it was not already.
   - Note that units that began their activation already threatened can never charge - a charge requires a charging movement, and threatened units cannot move except to change facing or disengage.

### DECLARE TARGET
- After choosing its method of attack, the attacker designates an enemy unit to be its target. All attacks during the attack sequence will be against the designated target.

- In order to be an eligible target of a **melee attack,** the target must meet the following requirements:
	- The target must be threatened by the attacker.  
	- The target must be a unit that has not already been attacked this command phase, if possible.

- In order to be an eligible target of a **missile attack**, the target must meet the following requirements:
	-  The target must be within range of the attacker’s missile weapon. Range is measured by counting the number of hexes from the attacker to the target (excluding the attacker’s hex, but including the target’s hex). To find the range, cross reference the attacker’s weapon with the target’s formation type on the Missile Ranges table. Units that include creatures of ogre size or larger should be treated as Mounted.
	-  The target must be within the **firing arc** of the attacker. A target is within the attacker’s firing arc if an imaginary line drawn straight from the center of the attacker’s hex to the center of the target’s hex would exit the attacker’s hex through the attacker’s front hexes. When the imaginary line exits at the vertex between the attacker’s front face and flank face, it counts as within the firing arc.
	-  The target must not be threatening or threatened by the attacker or a unit on the attacker’s side. Firing into a melee is too risky to the attacker’s allies.
	-  The target must be the closest enemy unit that meets the three requirements above, or one of the closest if multiple enemy units are equidistant.

![[Missile Ranges.png]]

### RESOLVE REACTION ATTACK SEQUENCE

Sometimes an attacker might attack into a bristling hedge of spears, or a withering fire of arrows, damaging and possibly repulsing it before it can make its own attack. These circumstances are addressed with the reaction attack sequence mechanics.

#### Reaction Attack Sequence
- After the target of an attack sequence is declared, the target or an adjacent unit on its side may be eligible to make a reaction attack sequence. To be eligible to conduct a reaction attack sequence, a unit must meet the following criteria:
	-  It must either be the target of the attack or be adjacent to the target of the attack. A unit may not react to attacks taking place across the battlemap.
	-  It must have a ready token, indicating it is ready to attack.
- Even if eligible, a unit is not required to make a reaction attack sequence. Only one reaction attack sequence may occur for each attack sequence, and if multiple units could react to an attack, the controlling commander decides which one, if any, reacts.
- When a reaction attack sequence occurs, the reacting unit may immediately change its facing so that the attacker is to its front, if it is not already. It then interrupts the attacker’s attack sequence and conducts its own attack sequence against the attacking enemy. A reaction attack sequence may be made with either melee or missile attacks. A reaction attack with missiles is permitted even if the attacker and target are threatening each other.
- The reaction attack sequence is resolved prior to resolving the next step of the attacker’s interrupted attack sequence. A reaction attack sequence follows the standard steps for an attack sequence, starting with Declare Method of Attack (p. 20), except that the target is always the original attacker, and this step is ignored (i.e. there are no nested reactions to reactions).
- A reaction attack sequence may, but does not have to be, a charge if the attack it is responding to was a charge. A reaction attack by spear- or pole arm-equipped Formed Foot units deals one extra point of damage when the attacker is charging if the reacting unit does not charge. (This represents the fact that spear and pole arms units **“set for charge”** deal extra damage to charging opponents.)
- If the attacker is not eliminated by the reaction attack against it, resolve the remaining steps of its attack. However, iit must attack the reacting unit instead of its original target, if the reacting unit is an eligible target. If, because of the reaction attack, neither the original target nor the reacting unit is an eligible target for the attacker, then the attacker’s attack sequence is cancelled.

### CHECK FOR FLANKING

A **melee** attack is flanking whenever the attacker is threatening the target, while the target is not threatening the attacker. This normally occurs when the attacker is conducting a melee attack against a target’s flank or rear hexes. It can also occur in unusual situations due to flying creatures, incorporeal monsters, and other situations discussed in later chapters.

A **missile** attack is flanking if an imaginary line drawn from the center of the attacker’s hex to the center of the target’s hex would enter the target’s hex through the target’s flank or rear hexes. When the imaginary line enters at the vertex between a target’s front face and flank face, it counts as flanking.

### MAKE ATTACK THROWS

All attacks, both missile and melee, are resolved using the attack throw mechanics of Adventurer Conqueror King. The attacker calculates the attack throw value required to hit from its base attack throw, the target’s Unit AC, and any situational modifiers. A D20 roll is then made for each of the attacker’s attacks. For each result equal to or greater than the modified attack throw value, a hit has been scored.

- Charging Attackers: A charging attacker gains a +2 bonus to attack throws against the charged target.
- Flanking Attackers: A flanking attacker gains a +2 bonus to attack throws against the flanked target.

Line of Sight (LOS): When conducting missile attacks, check if the attacker has line of sight to the target. An attacker has line of sight if it can trace an imaginary line from the center of its hex to the center of the target’s hex without crossing a hex containing an obstacle. If the imaginary line touches the border of the hex containing the obstacle, but does not actually cross the hex containing the obstacle, line of sight is not blocked. Obstacles include friendly units, enemy units, and certain types of terrain (p. 29). Units conducting missile attacks may still fire without line of sight, but do so at a penalty of -4 on their attack throw. This is known as volleying overhead.

Ammunition Depletion: A unit that rolls a natural 1 during a missile attack throw receives a depleted token. This indicates the unit is depleting its store of arrows, bolts, stones, or thrown weapons. Each depleted token reduces the unit’s number of attacks with that weapon by one per attack sequence.

### DEAL DAMAGE

For each successful attack by the attacker, one point of damage is dealt to the target’s uhp. Damage can be recorded on scratch paper or indicated by placing a damage token on the unit. Damage from all of the attacker’s attacks is applied simultaneously. A unit is destroyed (removed from the battle) when it has taken damage equal to its uhp. A unit becomes disordered as soon as damage is dealt to it.

#### Withdrawal: 
- When a Loose Foot, Loose Mounted, or Flyer unit takes damage, it may reduce damage dealt by one or more points by withdrawing one or more hexes, up to a maximum of its marching movement.
- To be eligible to withdraw from a missile attack, the unit must not have been disordered at the time the attack occurred. To be eligible to withdraw from a melee attack, the unit must not have been disordered at the time the attack occurred, and must have a faster marching movement rate than its attacker.
- The withdrawal must be directly away from the attacker. If a unit is eligible to withdraw into two or more hexes, the commander controlling the target decides which of the eligible hexes his unit withdraws into.
- The unit cannot withdraw into impassable terrain (p. 30). The unit cannot withdraw into a hex already containing an enemy unit, but may withdraw through friendly units, moving up to one additional hex if necessary to avoid ending its withdrawal in the same hex as a friendly unit. A unit’s facing does not change when it withdraws. If the unit cannot withdraw, it must take the damage.
- A unit which withdraws becomes disordered, even if the withdrawal reduces damage dealt to zero.


### RESOLVE SHOCK

Anytime a unit is damaged by magic, and/or each time an attack reduces a unit to 1⁄2 or less of its maximum uhp, a shock roll is required to see if the unit retreats or routs. To make a shock roll, the unit’s commander rolls 2d6, adds the unit’s morale score, and consults the Unit Shock table. The die roll should be modified based on the modifiers listed on the Shock Modifiers table

below.
![[Domains at war Shock Modifiers.png]]
- Domains at war shock modifierts
	- officer attached to unit + officers morale modifier
	- Unit is disordered -2
	- Unit has taken damage equal to 50% or more of its maximum uhp
	- Unit is threatened by enemy un its flank of rear hexes -2
	- Unit is Formed Foot or Formed Mounted and adjacent to at least thro friendly units

![[Domains at war Unit Shock Results.png]]

- Domains at war Unit Shock Results
	- 2 Rout
	- 3-5 Flee
	- 6-8 Recoil
	- 9+ Stand Firm
- (Note that in the absence of magic, the very conditions which trigger a shock roll will cause the unit to suffer the -2 penalty from being disordered and the -2 penalty from having taken damage equal to 50% or more of its maximum uhp. Shock rolls are nasty!)

- Rout: The unit immediately routs off the battlemap and is removed from play.
- Flee: The unit changes its facing towards its own battlemap edge and immediately retreats a number of hexes equal to its hustling movement rate in that direction. If a fleeing unit cannot complete its retreat, it is considered routed and removed from play [[202208070936 ACKS Domains at War Battles
- Recoil: The unit retreats one hex directly away from the attacker without changing facing. If a recoiling unit cannot complete its retreat, it flees (as above).

Stand Firm: The unit remains steady. No effect.  

#### Retreating
- f the target must retreat, resolve the retreat using the following rules:
-  If a unit is eligible to retreat into two or more hexes, the commander controlling the target decides which of the eligible hexes his unit retreats into.
-  A unit can retreat into any terrain (p. 29) except impassable terrain (p. 30).
-  A unit cannot retreat into, or through, a hex already containing a unit (except for loose units, see below).
-  If a unit’s retreat would cause it to exit the battlemap it is considered routed and removed from play. 
- If the target of a melee attack routs, retreats, or withdraws, the attacker may advance into the just-vacated hex. If the attacker is an Irregular unit, it must advance if possible. (The attacker may advance only one hex, regardless of the number of hexes the target retreated or withdrew.)
- Loose Units: Loose Foot, Loose Mounted, and Flyer units adopt a flexible, open formation that enables easy passage of lines. These units may retreat through any friendly units, and friendly units may retreat through them. They may still not retreat through enemy units, nor end their retreat in the same hex as another unit. Loose and Flyer units may retreat one additional hex if doing so is the only way to retreat without ending their movement in the same hex as another unit.
- Magic: Note that there will not be any magic in a battle unless you are using the rules in Chapter 4, Heroes.
- Voluntary Retreat: A Loose Mounted or Flyer unit which conducts a missile attack after standing fast may make a voluntary retreat of up to its marching move at the conclusion of its attack sequence. Each hex moved must take the unit directly away from its target, e.g. the Loose Mounted unit cannot “retreat” parallel to or towards the target. The Loose Mounted unit’s facing does not change when it voluntarily retreats.

##### Unpredictable Creatures: 
Normal troops tend to retreat when heavily damaged. Units including unpredictable creatures such as war dogs or elephants might instead go berserk, attacking friend and foe alike.

When an unpredictable units recoils, it normally retreats one hex directly away from the attacker without changing facing. However, if it cannot complete its retreat due to an intervening unit, the unpredictable unit immediately turns to face the unit which is blocking its retreat and conducts an immediate attack sequence against it (regardless of whether the unit is friend or enemy). This attack will be a trample (p. 51) if possible, and a charge if not. The unit will advance if possible after its attack sequence. If an unpredictable unit cannot complete its recoil due to impassable terrain (p. 30), it will flee instead.

When an unpredictable unit flees, it changes its facing towards its own battlemap edge and immediately retreats a number of hexes equal to its hustling movement rate. For each hex of its retreat, randomly determine which of the two eligible front hexes the unit retreats into – the unit’s commander does not get to choose! If the unpredictable unit cannot complete its randomly-determined retreat due to an intervening unit, it conducts an immediate attack sequence against it (regardless of whether the unit is friend or enemy). This attack will be a trample if possible, and a charge if not. After its attack sequence is resolved, the unit is considered routed and removed from play. If the unpredictable unit cannot complete its randomly- determined retreat due to impassable terrain, it is simply routed and removed from play.

## ACTIONS IN LIEU OF ATTACKING

Not every movement sequence ends in combat. In the moments before an engagement, units on the battlemap might form a shield wall, set for a charge (see above [[#RESOLVE REACTION ATTACK SEQUENCE]]) with spears, or ready to unleash a volley of arrows. These are known as actions in lieu of attacking and take the place of a unit’s attack sequence. Knowing when to attack, when to defend, and when to ready to attack is one of the most important skills that commanders must master to be successful in Domains at War: Battles.


### DEFEND

Historically, densely-packed armored infantry could protect themselves against attacks by forming their shields into an armored shell – the most famous example being the Roman testudo
To reflect this tactic, a Formed Foot unit that either stood fast or marched, and is not threatened by any enemy, may defend in lieu of attacking. Place a shielded token on the unit. While the shielded token is present, its Unit AC is increased by +2 versus melee and thrown attacks and +4 versus bow, crossbow, and sling attacks. It receives a +2 bonus on morale rolls. The shielded token is removed if the unit moves, attacks, or becomes disordered.

### READY TO ATTACK

In lieu of attacking, a unit that either stood fast or marched, and is not threatened by any enemy, may ready to attack. Place a ready token on the unit to mark its status. A ready unit may conduct a reaction attack when it, or a friendly unit adjacent to it, is declared to be the target of an attack. The ready token is removed if the unit moves, attacks, or becomes disordered.

Irregular units may not ready to attack, as they lack the discipline required to wait for enemy.

## MORALE PHASE

Armies do not, as a rule, fight to the last man (or elf, or orc). Instead they suffer a gradual loss of morale, becoming increasingly disordered as casualties mount, until eventually the army is swept away in a rout. These effects are simulated with morale rolls.

During the Morale Phase, every unit in the entire army must make a morale roll if:

-  The army’s general was destroyed, routed, or voluntarily exited from the battle during the preceding combat round; or
    
-  One or more units in the army were lost (destroyed or routed) during the preceding combat round, and the total number of units lost is now equal to or greater than the army’s break point. An army’s break point is always 1/3 of the army’s starting number of units, rounded up.

Unlike shock rolls  [[202208070936 ACKS Domains at War Battles#RESOLVE SHOCK]]
, which can occur several times per combat round (e.g. if a unit takes damage reducing it to 1⁄2 hp or less from several different attacks), a unit only ever makes one morale roll per combat round. For instance, if the army’s general is destroyed and the army reaches its break point in the same combat round, the army’s units still only make one morale roll.

### MORALE ROLLS

To make a morale roll, the unit’s commander rolls 2d6, adds the unit’s morale score, and consults the Unit Morale table. The die roll should be modified based on the army and unit modifiers listed on the Morale Modifiers table below.
![[Morale Modifier Table.png]]
- Morale Roll Modifier Table
	- Army Modifiers (apply to all units)
		- general present on battlemap: + 0,5 of generals Morale modifier
		- Army has lose 1/2 or more of its starting units, but less than 2/3: -2
		- Army has lost 2/3 of its starting units: -5
		- Army has destroyed or routed more units opposed than opposing army has destroyed or routed: +2
		- Army has lost more units than opposing army has lost - 2
		- Army cannot retreat (surrounded, trapped, etc.) +2
		- Army defending homeland/sacred ground: Judges discretion.
	- Unit Modifiers
		- Officer attached to unit: + morale modifier
		- Unit is disordered: -2
		- Unit has taken damage of 50% or more of its uhp: -2
		- Unit is threatened by enemy in its flank or rear hexes -2
		- Unit is Formed Food or Formed Mounted and adjacent to at least two friendly units: +2
		- unit is shielded: + 2
![[Morale Roll Results.png]]
- Morale Roll Results
- <2 **Rout**: The unit immediately routs off the battlemap and is removed from play.
- **Flee**: The unit immediately becomes disordered (if not already), changes its facing towards its own battlemap edge, and immediately retreats a number of hexes equal to its hustling movement rate in that direction. If a fleeing unit cannot complete its retreat, it is considered routed and removed from play.
- **Waver**: The unit immediately becomes disordered, if not already. If already disordered, it retreats one hex towards its own battlemap edge. If the unit cannot complete its retreat, it flees (as above).
- **Stand Firm**: The unit remains steady. No effect.
- **Rally**: The unit rallies under the pressure of battle. If the unit is disordered, the disordered token is removed. If the unit is not disordered, it recovers one lost uhp and, if unthreatened, may advance one hex towards an enemy unit.
Retreats, where necessary, follow the same rules as those caused by shock rolls.  [[202208070936 ACKS Domains at War Battles#Retreating]]

The army’s general determines the order in which his units will make morale rolls. The effects of each morale roll are resolved before rolling for the next unit. It is possible for the results of earlier morale rolls to impact those of later rolls, causing a cascade of flight off the battlefield.

If both sides must make morale rolls during the same combat round, the side whose general has the lower leadership ability must make all of its morale rolls first. In the event of a tie, determine the order of the morale rolls randomly.

ENDING BATTLES

A battle ends when all of the units of one army have been destroyed, routed, or voluntarily exited from the battlemap. When a battle ends, the victorious army will have the opportunity to pursue the defeated army. After pursuit is resolved, each army will determine casualties.

PURSUIT

A victorious army is eligible to pursue its defeated opponent. Pursuit is handled with a series of pursuit throws. The victorious army receives one pursuit throw per eligible pursuing unit.

Pursuit Eligibility: Determine which units from the victorious army are eligible to pursue as follows.

1. Did the defeated army end the battle without any Mounted or Flyer units (e.g. all such units were routed or destroyed)? If yes, then all units in the victorious army are eligible to pursue.

2. In all other cases, only Mounted and Flyer units in the victorious army are eligible to pursue.

![[Pursuit Roll DCs.png]]

For each eligible pursuing unit, the victorious army’s commander makes a pursuit throw against the appropriate value from the table above. 
Add +4 to each pursuit throw if all of the defeated army’s Mounted and Flyer units were destroyed or routed. Each successful throw eliminates one enemy unit. If the defeated army ended the battle without any Mounted or Flyer units, the victorious army general may choose which unit(s) are eliminated. Otherwise the defeated army’s general may choose which unit(s) are eliminated.


Pursuit against Evading Armies: Certain strategic situations, including rear guard actions, rear guard envelopments, and skirmishes, involve offensive armies fighting evading armies. (See Chapter 3, Strategic Situations, for more details). The longer it takes to defeat an evading army, the harder it is for the offensive army to pursue. Each combat round of the battle imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to pursuit throws against a defeated evading army. (A natural roll of 20 always eliminates a unit, regardless of any modifiers.)

CASUALTIES

After pursuit, each army’s commander will determine his army’s casualties. Units that were destroyed or dealt damage will have lost some or all of their troops.

Destroyed Units: Half of the troops (rounded up) are crippled or dead, while the other half (rounded down) are lightly wounded. The victorious army’s wounded troops return to their unit in one week. The defeated army’s wounded troops become prisoners.


Damaged Units: Damaged units will suffer casualties in proportion to their loss of uhp. Divide the amount of damage taken by the unit’s starting uhp (round up). This is the percentage of the troops that became casualties. Half of these casualties (rounded up) are crippled or dead, while the other half (rounded down) are wounded. The victorious army’s wounded troops return to their unit in one week. Half (rounded up) of the defeated army’s wounded troops become prisoners and half return to their unit in one week.

Routed Units: Routed units will suffer casualties in proportion to their loss of uhp, as per a damaged unit. However, fewer of the unit’s wounded return to the unit. Half of a victorious army’s routed, wounded troops become deserters (round up). Half of the defeated army’s routed, wounded troops become prisoners (round up), and the rest become deserters.



Half-strength units may be consolidated to form a smaller number of full-strength units, if desired.




IMPORTANT NOTE
If the battle is part of a campaign, each army will also gather spoils of war and calculate experience points for its officers and troops. These rules are found in the Aftermath of Battles section of Domains at War: Campaigns.

OTHER SPELLS

All other spells can only be used to affect friendly and enemy heroes. The ranges of all spells must be translated into hexes according the ground scale of 1 hex equaling 60 feet. Spells with a duration of 1 turn or more last for the duration of the battle, or until dispelled. The following other notes apply:

Charms: If a hero is charmed, he falls under the control of the opposing army until the charm is dispelled. If a unit under the command of a charmed commander is ordered to attack its allies, make a morale roll for the unit. Add the charmed commander’s morale modifier and subtracting the army general’s morale modifier.

On a result of 2-, the unit will attempt to kill their charmed commander. On a result of 3-5, the unit will attempt to capture or subdue him. On a 6-8, the unit will take no action. On 9-11, the unit will follow his commands. On a 12+, the unit will follow his commands, and when the charm is dispelled, another morale roll will be required to get them to stop attacking their former comrades! (Ah, the price of fanaticism...)

Darkness/Light/Silence: A blinded or silenced hero cannot activate units other than himself or cast spells, and does not provide morale bonuses to friendly units. These effects remain until dispelled.

Hold: A held hero cannot activate units or be activated. If attached to a unit, he is immediately detached. He can be slain by a threatening unit or hero as an action in lieu of attacking.

Summoning: When a summoning spell (such as summon djinni or summon fantastic creature) is cast, the summoned creature should be treated as a hero under the control of the caster.

assault: a method of capturing a stronghold in which the besieging army attacks the stronghold directly to capture it with force of arms.

attach: (a) in the Basic Rules, each officer counter must be placed on a unit counter. The officer is said to be “attached” to that unit. During the battle, officers move with the unit they are attached to. They do not move or attack independent of their unit, and do not directly affect combat. (b) When using Heroes, a hero may be placed on a unit counter. The hero is said to be “attached” to that unit. During the battle, attached heroes move with the unit they are attached to. They may attack with their unit, receiving their own attack throw(s).

Cavalry will always have either Formed Mounted, Irregular Mounted, Loose Mounted, or Flyer formation.

cavalry unit: a unit in which man-sized riders, are seated on large-sized mounts. (In contrast, man-sized riders seated on huge, gigantic, or colossal creatures form behemoth cavalry units; while man-sized troops fighting from vehicles form chariots). A cavalry unit will always have either Formed Mounted, Irregular Mounted, Loose Mounted, or Flyer formation.

character: an individual within the game-world.

charge (attack): any melee attack made by an attacker that charged during its movement sequence. Charging grants a +2 bonus to attack throws. Formed Foot and any Mounted units equipped with spears, polearms, or lances deal one extra point of damage during charges if they hit with at least one attack with these weapons. Mounted units also receive bonus attacks when they charge, based on the mount’s attack characteristics. A unit that makes a charge attack always becomes disordered if it was not already.

charge (movement): to move a number of hexes up to a unit’s charging movement rate. Each hex of movement must be into one of the unit’s front hexes. The unit cannot change its facing before, during, or while charging. A unit which charges immediately becomes disordered. During its attack sequence, a charging unit can attack with melee weapons. However, a charging unit does not have to attack; a unit can charge simply to move across the battlemap quickly if desired.

company scale: the standard scale of Domains at War, used for battles of 601 to 3,000 combatants. A company-scale unit represents 120 infantry, 60 cavalry, or an equivalent number of larger creatures. Each company-scale hex is 60' across. Each company-scale combat round is 10 seconds long.

condition: a circumstance that modifies the characteristics or available actions of a unit. Conditions are marked with tokens.

condition token: a 1" x 1" marker used to indicate a unit has a particular condition.

constituent creature: one of the individual creatures within a unit. In a standard unit, the constituent creatures are all

identical. In a mixed unit, there may be a variety of different constituent creatures.

damaged: a condition indicating a unit has taken damage in combat. A unit is destroyed and removed from a battle when it has taken damage equal to its unit hit points.

deep envelopment: a strategic situation in which an offensive army is surprised by an attack by an opposing army on its front and rear. Every division from each army participates in the battle.

defend: an action in lieu of attacking which grants the unit the shielded condition.

delay: when a commander takes his command phase at a lower initiative score than he rolled. A commander may delay his command phase until the negative value of his initiative score, but must take his command phase then.

depleted: a condition indicating a unit has depleted its store of ammunition. Each depleted token reduces the unit’s number of attacks per attack sequence when using that weapon by one.

deployment: the initial placement of an army’s units on the battlemap. In most strategic situations, each side deploys its units simultaneously and in secret.

deployment restriction: the rules that units must obey when being set up in the deployment zone. Some strategic situations impose additional deployment restrictions.

deployment zone: the area on the battlemap in which an army may be deployed during set up.

detach: an attached hero may detach from his unit at the start of any initiative phase, prior to initiative being rolled. Remove the hero’s counter from the unit’s counter and place it in the unit’s hex to indicate the hero has detached. The newly independent hero may roll for initiative and activate himself that round. An officer who would not qualify to be hero except for his status as a commander or lieutenant may not detach from his unit.

# disengagement: 
A disengagement enables a unit that starts its movement sequence threatened to move away from the unit which is threatening it. A disengagement triggers one free melee attack sequence from each threatening enemy unit which is not disordered. However, a disengaging Loose Foot, Loose Mounted, or Flyer unit does not trigger attacks by threatening units that have a slower marching movement rate than it. If an attack sequence is triggered by disengagement, the attacker applies a special +2 bonus to hit the disengaging unit. If multiple attack sequences are triggered, the disengaging unit chooses the order in which the threatening units’ attack sequences are resolved.

# disordered: 
a condition indicating a unit has had its formation disrupted by rapid movement, casualties, etc. A unit becomes disordered if it charges, withdraws, or takes damage. Disordered units suffer a -2 penalty to their Unit AC, shock rolls, and morale rolls, and cost 1 additional activation point to activate. A disordered unit is marked by placing a disordered token on it. The disordered token is removed the next time the unit is activated.


division: a group of units positioned in proximity to each other in an army’s line of battle and supervised by a commander reporting to the army’s leader. A division typically consists of three to eight units.

domain: an area of land secured by a stronghold.

epic fortified structure: a structure, used in an epic scale battle, abstracted from a standard scale structure’s physical layout.

epic scale: a means of handling large battles. At epic scale, each unit represents a larger body of troops, each hex represents a larger area of ground, and each round represents a lengthier period of time. There are two epic scales available, each named for the relative size of the units: battalion scale and brigade scale.

exterior fortified structure: an exterior fortified structure is a structure in a hex adjacent to one or more hexes that do not contain other fortified structures of the stronghold.

facing: the hex vertex towards which a unit’s counter is oriented. A unit’s facing impacts its ability to move and fight on the battlemap.

flank hexes: the two hexes to the left and right of a unit’s current hex.

flanking attack: (a) a melee attack wherein the attacker is threatening the target, while the target is not threatening the attacker. (b) A missile attack wherein an imaginary line drawn from the center of the attacker’s hex to the center of the target’s hex would enter the target’s hex through the target’s flank or rear hexes. A flanking attacker gains a +2 bonus to attack throws against the flanked target.

flee: a possible result of a shock roll or morale roll. A fleeing unit changes its facing towards its own battlemap edge and immediately retreats a number of hexes equal to its hustling movement rate in that direction. If a fleeing unit cannot complete its retreat, it is considered routed and removed from play.

flyer (FLY): aerial monsters or cavalry. Flyers generally fly wingtip-to-wingtip in order to maximize striking power, with as few as 5 and as many as 60 in a unit depending on size. Some flyers carry riders equipped with lances or bows and serve as highly mobile cataphracts. Other flyers rely on beak and talon. A Flyer unit can only be threatened by an enemy Flyer or by an enemy unit conducting a reaction attack against the Flyer. Flyers can march or hustle through friendly units, and be marched or hustled through by friendly units. A disengaging Flyer does not trigger attacks by threatening units that have a slower marching movement rate than it. Flyers equipped with spears, polearms, or lances deal one extra point during charges if they hit with at least one attack. Flyers might also receive bonus attacks when they charge. When a Flyer unit is hit, it may be eligible to reduce damage dealt by one or more points by withdrawing one or more hexes, up to a maximum of its marching movement. Flyers may retreat through any friendly units, and friendly units may retreat through them. They may

retreat one additional hex if doing so is the only way to retreat without ending their movement in the same hex as another unit. A Flyer which conducts a missile attack after remaining stationary may make a voluntary retreat of up to its marching move at the conclusion of its attack sequence. As an action in lieu of attacking, Flyers may ready to attack. Flyers may choose to fly above rough, impassable, or obscuring terrain if desired, and are treated as elevated when doing so. Flyers may move and attack as if elevated one or more levels above the surrounding hex if desired.

foot unit: a unit with a unit formation of either FF (Formed Foot), IF (Irregular Foot), or LF (Loose Foot). Foot units are always infantry, but infantry are not always Foot units. For example, a company of 60 hellhounds without riders would technically be infantry, but it would be a Mounted unit, not a Foot unit, because of its Irregular Mounted formation.

formed foot (FF): highly-disciplined soldiers fighting shoulder- to-shoulder in close order, with a frontage of one soldier every 3'. Formed Foot are sturdy defenders, usually heavily armed and armored. They are used to take or hold ground in close combat. During deployment, Formed Foot may form a phalanx with another similarly-equipped FF unit. FF units equipped with spears, polearms, or lances deal one extra point during charges if they hit with at least one attack. As actions in lieu of attacking, FF may defend or ready to attack. A reaction attack by spear- or pole arm-equipped FF units deals one extra point of damage when the attacker is charging if the reacting unit does not charge. FF adjacent to at least two friendly units gain +2 to morale rolls.

formed mounted (FM): highly-disciplined cavalry mounted on medium or heavy warhorses fighting in close order (knee to knee). A frontage of one horse per 4' is typical. Formed Mounted are generally shock troops equipped with lances, but some (cataphracts) may carry and use composite bows, which they use to disorder their foes before finishing them off with a charge. FM units equipped with spears, polearms, or lances deal one extra point during charges if they hit with at least one attack. FM units might also receive bonus attacks when they charge, based on the mount’s attack characteristics. As actions in lieu of attacking, FM may ready to attack. FM adjacent to at least two friendly units gain +2 to morale rolls. FM units may not charge into, through, or from rough terrain.

fortified structure: a keep, gatehouse, tower, length of wall or other building. A set of one or more fortified structures securing a domain is called a stronghold.

hero: an officer that can move and/or fight independently of a unit. In company-scale battles, a hero must be one of the following: a general, commander or lieutenant; a PC or NPC


of at least 7th level; a monster of at least 9 HD and functioning outside of a unit; or a spellcaster capable of third level arcane spells or fifth level divine spells.

hero officer characteristics: a hero’s officer characteristics come into play if he serves as a general, commander, or lieutenant. A hero’s officer characteristics include leadership ability, zone of control, strategic ability, and morale modifier.

hero personal characteristics: a hero’s personal characteristics are used when the hero attacks or is attacked by another hero. A hero’s personal characteristics include movement rate, AC, HD, hp, attack throw, number of attacks, damage, saving throws, initiative modifier, and special abilities.

hero unit characteristics: a hero’s unit characteristics are used when the character attacks or is attacked by a unit. A heroic character’s unit characteristics include unit movement rate, unit formation, unit armor class, unit hit dice, unit attacks, and unit morale. Note that heroes do not have uhp – as explained below, attacks against heroes always deal personal hp of damage.

hero, attached: a hero that moves and fight with a unit. An attached hero’s counter is placed on the counter of the unit he is attached to.

hero, independent: a hero that moves and fight virtually as a unit himself. An independent hero’s counter is placed in the hex he occupies, facing one of that hex’s six vertices.

hex: a six-sided segment of the battlemap representing an area of ground 60' across that regulates the movement and combat of units.

hoist: a siege engine used by assaulting troops to ascend to the top of a wall.

hustle: to move a number of hexes up to a unit’s hustling movement rate. A hustling unit can change its facing in any direction prior to moving, but each hex of movement thereafter must be into one of its front hexes. The unit can change its facing while hustling, but each 60-degree facing change counts as one hex of movement. A hustling unit cannot take an attack sequence.

infantry: any troop which fights on foot, without a mount or vehicle. Infantry will usually have either Formed Foot, Irregular Foot, or Loose Foot formation. However, quadrupedal troops such as dire wolves or centaurs will have a Mounted formation, while winged troops such as harpies will have a Flyer formation, even though they are technically “infantry”.

initiative roll: a roll made by each commander during the initiative phase of every combat round.

initiative score: a number that determines the order in which a commander’s command phase will occur during a combat round. A commander’s initiative score is calculated by rolling 1d6 and adding the commander’s strategic ability score.

irregular foot (IM): poorly-trained and undisciplined bands of warriors. They are incapable of any advanced tactics and must rely on individual ferocity or sheer mass. Irregular Foot units may not disengage or ready to attack, due to lack of discipline. IF units must attack if able. If the target of an IF unit’s attack

recoils, flees, or routs, the Irregular Foot unit must advance if possible.

irregular mounted (IM): poorly-trained and undisciplined cavalry, packs of wild beasts, and riders of particularly aggressive, unpredictable, or vicious mounts. Irregular Mounted units may not disengage or ready to attack, due to lack of discipline. Irregular Foot units must attack if able. IM units equipped with spears, polearms, or lances deal one extra point during charges if they hit with at least one attack. IM units might also receive bonus attacks when they charge, based on the mount’s attack characteristics. If the target of an Irregular Mounted unit’s attack recoils, flees, or routs, the IM unit must advance if possible. IM units may not charge into, through, or from rough terrain.

judge: a participant in a game of ACKS who controls NPCs.

labor unit: a unit formed during deployment by merging two identical units into one. Labor units count as two units of crew for purposes of moving siege towers.

leader: a character who controls a domain or realm.

leadership ability: a character’s capability to give orders and have them obeyed. Leadership ability determines the number of activation points (AP) that a commander receives. It also determines the number of divisions a general may have in his army. Leadership ability ranges from 1 to 8.

leading from the rear: taking up a position at the rear of a unit in order to reduce an attached hero’s visibility distance to 0 hexes. A hero leading from the rear cannot attack or act in lieu of attacking. An attached hero cannot lead from the rear if he is of a larger size than that of the constituent troops of his unit.

lieutenant: an officer in charge of an individual unit. Lieutenants increase their unit’s morale, make the unit easier to control, and can replace division commanders lost in battle.

line of sight: an attacker has line of sight if it can trace an imaginary line from the center of its hex to the center of the target’s hex without crossing a hex containing an obstacle. ^c01968

loose foot (LF): well-trained soldiers fighting in open order, with a frontage of one soldier every 5' to 6'. Their extended formation allows them to easily pass through or around obstacles or friendly units, and to withdraw in the face of enemy missiles or heavy troops. LF units can march or hustle through friendly units, and be marched or hustled through by friendly units. A disengaging LF unit does not trigger attacks by threatening units that have a slower marching movement rate than it. When a LF unit is hit, it may be eligible to reduce damage dealt by one or more points by withdrawing one or more hexes, up to a maximum of its marching movement. LF may retreat through any friendly units, and friendly units may retreat through them. LF may retreat one additional hex if doing so is the only way to retreat without ending their movement in the same hex as another unit. As an action in lieu of attacking, LF may ready to attack.

loose mounted (LM): well-trained cavalry mounted on light warhorses fighting in an extended order. A frontage of one horse per 6' to 8' is typical. Generally equipped with bows, javelins, or other missile weapons, Loose Mounted units use their speed and mobility to harass and disorder enemy forces.

LM units can march or hustle through friendly units, and be marched or hustled through by friendly units. A disengaging LM unit does not trigger attacks by threatening units that have a slower marching movement rate than it. LM units equipped with spears, polearms, or lances deal one extra point during charges if they hit with at least one attack. When a LM unit is hit, it may be eligible to reduce damage dealt by one or more points by withdrawing one or more hexes, up to a maximum of its marching movement. LM may retreat through any friendly units, and friendly units may retreat through them. They may retreat one additional hex if doing so is the only way to retreat without ending their movement in the same hex as another unit. A LM unit which conducts a missile attack after remaining stationary may make a voluntary retreat of up to its marching move at the conclusion of its attack sequence. As an action in lieu of attacking, LM units may ready to attack. LM units may not charge into, through, or from rough terrain.

standalone scenario: battles fought outside of the context of an ongoing role-playing game campaign.

standard unit: a unit which consists exclusively of creatures of the same race, class, level, Hit Dice, and equipment.

story: the number of levels or floors in the fortified structure. Multi-story structures can be thought of as a series of one-story structures “stacked” on top of each other. Each story has its own unit capacity and its own structural hit points. Units in each story of the structure are considered adjacent to units in the story above and below them. Units may move between stories at a rate of one story per hex of movement. In general, there is one story per 10' - 15' of height.

strategic ability: a character’s military puissance and effectiveness. Strategic ability modifies an officer’s initiative roll each combat round. (Strategic ability also plays a significant role in certain mechanics in Domains at War: Campaigns). Strategic ability ranges from -3 to +6.

strategic situation: the circumstances under which two opposing armies meet for battle. There are eight strategic situations: pitched battle, meeting engagement, rear guard action, skirmish, ambush, envelopment, deep envelopment, and rear guard envelopment.

stronghold: a fortified structure securing a domain.

structural hit points (shp): a structure’s ability to remain intact despite damage. A structure reduced to 1⁄2 its starting shp has been breached. A structure reduced to 0 shp is destroyed. When a structure is destroyed, collapsing stone and timber deal 8 hits to any occupying units and 8d6 damage to any occupying heroes. A saving throw versus Blast will reduce damage to half. Structures with multiple stories have a separate shp per story. Each story must be breached or destroyed separately.

swoop: certain creatures can swoop on enemy units with particular methods of attack. In order to swoop, the attacker must charge during its movement sequence and use its swoop attack(s) in the subsequent attack sequence. The swooping unit deals one additional point of damage if it hits with at least one of its swoop attacks. Additionally, if any of the swoop attack throws is an unmodified 20, then the swooping unit has grabbed creatures from among the target unit and flown off with them. This inflicts additional damage equal to the target unit’s own Hit Dice, unless the target unit makes a successful saving throw versus Paralysis. A swooping unit can only fly off with creatures from the target unit if they are of a smaller size than the swooping creatures.

tactical modifier: a factor used in calculating a creature’s battle rating, representing how effective the creature is at using its special abilities.

target: the enemy unit against which an attack sequence is directed. In order to be an eligible target for an attack, a unit must meet certain requirements.

terrain characteristic: a trait that a terrain piece may possess, such as elevated, impassable, obscuring, and/or rough. Terrain may have multiple characteristics, in which case the effects stack.

terrain piece: a geographical feature such as a hill, stream, grove of forest, or patch of mud, placed on the battlemap. There are three sizes of terrain pieces: small (one hex), medium (three hexes), and large (seven hexes). Each terrain piece is of a particular terrain type with certain terrain characteristics.

terrain type: the nature of a terrain piece, such as broken ground, forest, or mud. Each terrain type has certain terrain characteristics.

terrain type, broken ground: broken ground is rough terrain. Loose Foot units in broken ground gain a +2 bonus to AC.

terrain type, cliff/mountain: cliff/mountains are elevated terrain. Cliff/mountains are impassable except at designated passes up them.

terrain type, ford: fords are hexes of mud terrain placed to allow movement across wide streams.

terrain type, pass: passes are one-hex wide pieces of elevated terrain that provide access to cliffs/mountains.

terrain type, forest/jungle: forest/jungles are rough and obscuring terrain.

terrain type, hill: hills are elevated terrain.  
terrain type, impenetrable forest: impenetrable forests are impassable and obscuring terrain.

terrain type, mud: mud is rough terrain. Units in mud suffer a -1 AC penalty against missile fire. War Machinery treats mud as impassable.

terrain type, pond/lake: ponds/lakes are impassable.

terrain type, stream: streams are lines of varying length and width. Units adjacent to a stream receive a +2 bonus to AC against melee attacks. Units crossing a stream suffer a -2 penalty to their AC until they reach the other bank.

terrain type, swamp: swamps are rough and obscuring terrain. War Machinery treats swamp as impassable.

terrain type, trench: trenches are lines of varying length and width. Units adjacent to a stream receive a +2 bonus to AC against melee attacks. Units crossing a stream suffer a -2 penalty to their AC until they reach the other bank. Units that enter a wide trench may move along its length, treating it as rough terrain. Units moving along a trench are below the line of sight of attacks which are not on elevated terrain. War Machinery cannot cross, enter, or move along trenches.

terrain, elevated: terrain such as cliffs/mountains and hills. Elevated terrain blocks line of sight in some cases, but in other cases it allows units to see over obstacles. Units on elevated terrain receive +1 to attack throws against units on unelevated elevation. Units on a lower elevation can only conduct missile attacks on targets on elevated terrain using volleying overhead, even if line of sight can be drawn. Flyers may move and attack as if elevated one or more levels above the surrounding hex if desired.

terrain, impassable: impassable terrain includes cliffs, impenetrable forests, and bodies of water. When terrain is impassable, it may not be moved into or through by any unit without special capabilities. Flyers may fly over impassable terrain if desired, and are treated as elevated when doing so.

terrain, obscuring: obscuring terrain includes forests, jungles, and swamps. Line of sight may be traced to and from the edge of an obscuring hex, but may not be traced through a complete hex of obscuring terrain. Units in obscuring terrain receive a +2 bonus to AC against missiles and may not be targeted by volleying overhead. Flyers may choose to fly above obscuring terrain if desired, and are treated as elevated when doing so.

terrain, rough: rough terrain includes broken ground, forests, jungles, mud, and swamp. When terrain is rough, it means that each hex moved through the terrain counts as two hexes of movement. (Units may always march a minimum of one hex in rough terrain, however). Mounted units may not charge into, through, or from rough terrain. Flyers may choose to fly above rough if desired, and are treated as elevated when doing so.

threaten: to be in a threatening position towards an enemy unit.

threatened: a unit occupying one of the front hexes of an enemy unit is said to be threatened by the enemy unit. The front hexes of an enemy unit are said to be threatened hexes. ^7e5f02

threatening: a unit positioned such that an enemy unit occupies one of its front hexes is said to be threatening the enemy unit. A unit is said to be threatening its front hexes.

top story: the uppermost story of a fortified structure. The top story is the most vulnerable story of a structure, as assaulting units may enter it by means of flight, siege ladders, hoists, or siege towers, even if the top story is not breached.

trample: certain units can trod enemy underfoot with particular methods of attack. In order to trample, the unit must charge during its movement sequence or be recoiling or fleeing due to unpredictable morale, and use its trample attack(s) in the subsequent attack sequence. A trampling unit gains a +4 bonus to its attack throws if the target unit is constituted of man-sized or smaller creatures.

trebuchet: a one-armed siege engine which hurls rocks, burning pitch, and other projectiles from a sling affixed to a long throwing arm. Trebuchets can be powered by traction (via men pulling on the throwing arm) or by gravity (via counterweight mechanisms fixed to the throwing arm). Traction trebuchets are simpler and less expensive but counterweight trebuchets are more precise. Trebuchets have the same benefits and drawbacks as catapults when targeting creatures and structures.

unit: a company-sized formation of troops. A unit may have up to 120 infantry, 60 large (cavalry or ogre-sized) creatures, 20 huge (giant-sized) creatures, 5 gigantic creatures, or 1 colossal creature. Each unit is represented by a unit counter.

unit armor class (unit AC): a measure of how hard a unit is to damage. Unit AC ranges from 0 to 10 or more. Most light units will have an AC of 0-3, while heavier troops will have a Unit AC of 4-7.

unit attack: an indicator of how often and accurately a unit may attack with a particular method. Unit attack is presented in the format [number of attacks] [method of attack] [attack throw], e.g. 2 spear and shield 11+.

unit capacity: the number of company-sized units that can defend a fortified structure. Since most fortified structures consist of multiple stories, unit capacity is per story.

unit counter: a 2" x 1 1/8" counter used to represent a unit on the battlemap.

unit formation: a classification of the sort of tactics and maneuvers a unit is capable of. The unit formations are Formed Foot, Formed Mounted, Irregular Foot, Irregular Mounted, Loose Foot, Loose Mounted, Flyer, and War Machinery.

unit hit dice (unit HD): a measure of a unit’s fighting power. Most units have around 1 Unit HD.

unit hit points (uhp): a measure of a unit’s resilience in the face of combat. Most units have 4-8 uhp.

unit morale: how likely a unit is to retreat when it takes casualties. It ranges from -6 to +4, with most units having morale scores of -1 to +1.

unit movement rate: how many hexes a unit can move per round. Each unit has three separate movement rates: marching, hustling, and charging, presented in the format [marching]/[hustling]/[charging].

unit type: a general designator of the unit’s size, training, and equipment.

unpredictable creature: a creature which may go berserk and attack friend and foe alike when heavily damaged. Unpredictable creatures are indicated with a [u] after their morale score.

vanguard: divisions of an army that lead the marching order and are the most likely to fight an offensive battle. One-quarter to one-third of an army’s divisions may be in the vanguard.

visibility distance: the maximum number of hexes at which a hero or other officer may be an eligible target of an attack, spell, or special ability by a unit or hero targeting him. Visibility distance is determined by the size of the targeted hero.

volleying overhead: a unit conducting missile attacks without line of sight. Volleying overhead imposes a penalty of -4 on the unit’s attack throw.

voluntary retreat: a movement of one or more hexes directly away from a target by a Loose Mounted or Flyer unit which has conducted a missile attack after remaining stationary. ^a1954e

war machinery (WM): all types of crewed pieces of artillery and siege equipment, including battery rams, galleries, hoists, mantlets, screws, siege ladders, and siege towers. As actions in lieu of attacking, War Machinery units may ready to attack. WM units treat mud and swamp terrain as impassable. WM units may not cross, enter, or move along trenches.

waver: a possible result of a morale roll. The unit immediately becomes disordered, if not already. If already disordered, it retreats one hex towards its own battlemap edge. If the unit cannot complete its retreat, it flees.

withdrawal: a movement of one or more hexes directly away from a successful attacker by a Hero, or Loose Foot, Loose Mounted, or Flyer unit, up to a maximum of its marching movement. Each hex withdrawn reduces damage dealt to the withdrawing hero or unit by one point.

# zone of control (ZOC): 
the radius, in hexes, within which a commander may activate units in his division without penalty. ZOC is always equal to one-half the commander’s leadership ability, rounded up. ZOC is measured by counting the number of hexes from the commander’s hex to the unit in question (excluding the commander’s hex, but including the hex of the unit to be ordered).
