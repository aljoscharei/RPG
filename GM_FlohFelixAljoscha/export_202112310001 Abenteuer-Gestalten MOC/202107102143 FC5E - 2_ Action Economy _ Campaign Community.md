**Mastering the 5e Action Economy**

The action economy is a concept that each player character (PC) or creature’s turns can be broken down into a limited number of actions. If we break down the anatomy of combat turn, we can see that this is the case.

The Anatomy of a Turn:

*   Movement
*   Action
*   Bonus Action
*   Reaction

PCs tend to have more reliable access to Bonus Actions or unique Reactions. This means the action economy is skewed in the party’s favor.

The more action economy one side has, the more they can do each round, giving them additional opportunities at claiming victory.

In this lesson, you will learn how to assess a creature’s action economy so you can bridge this natural gap between both sides.

**Before We Begin…**

Before we can bridge this gap you’ll need to determine how substantial the gap is. To do this you assess the creature(s) you intend to use as well as the party.

Thankfully, you can use the same procedure for both types of assessments.

You also won’t need to frequently reassess the party’s action economy. Do a quick reassessment whenever you feel they’ve gained a bunch of new features or when you reach a new level tier.

Creatures, on the other hand, warrant a quick action economy evaluation as you assess their statblocks to determine their other strengths and weaknesses.

### **Our Control Creature**
A proper examination requires a baseline or Control. The Control of an action economy assessment is a stereotypical adventurer.

A Medium-sized Adventurer

1.  30 ft. of movement
2.  Two attacks per Action
    Extra Attack feature Improved Cantrip AoE spells/features
    
3.  Regular use of a Bonus Action

Comparing a PC or creature to this Control will showcase their action economy’s value and in what ways they are better or worse than a typical adventurer.

**Assessing a Creature’s Action Economy**

Now that we have the background information squared away, let’s learn how to apply this knowledge.

**Movement**

First, consider the creature’s movement per turn. Based on our control we can see that if they have 30 ft. of movement they have an average amount of movement.

The more movement they have, the better their action economy is. The opposite is true if they have less than 30 ft. of movement.

Also, take unique types of movement into account. For instance, a creature with flying or swimming speed may also warrant some bonus points in this category depending on the terrain you've selected.

**Traits**

Next, assess the creature’s traits. Do they have a trait that grants them a useful Bonus Action each turn? Few creatures do. Those that have a useful Bonus Action generally have great action economies.

**Actions**

Now examine the creature’s actions. Most creatures will have a Multiattack. Keep in mind that their Multiattack must include at least two individual attacks to be on-par with the Control.

Many creatures also have other Actions, such as spells or Area of Effect attacks. Take these into account as well. The ability to hit multiple enemies at once has a similar (or better) value to a Multiattack.

Some creatures may have a unique Reaction that can be used each round. This is practically an additional action and therefore has a considerable amount of action economy value.

**Legendary Creatures**

A legendary creature is a powerful creature designed to push the party to its limits. These foes come with a set of unique actions in the form of Lair Actions, Legendary Actions, or both.

Legendary and Lair Actions won’t come up often, but when they do be sure to add them to your assessment as they can be powerful tools in combat.

**Compare and Contrast**

Last, take your assessment and compare the creature with the Control.

For example, a creature with 40 ft. of movement speed and a unique Reaction will have a leg-up on the Control in two different aspects of the action economy.

If everything else about the two is similar, you can deduce that the creature has an above-average action economy.

While this method won’t give you an exact numerical value for a creature’s action economy, it will provide an idea as to how good or bad the creature’s action economy is.

Keep in mind that you can substitute the Control from this lesson for the party’s current action economy any time to gain a better insight as to how your creatures will fare in combat.

This comparison will reveal what to fine-tune in your encounter to further level the playing field between the creatures and the party if there is an action economy discrepancy that favors the party too much.

Let’s do a couple of examples to better illustrate how to judge a creature’s action economy.

**Example [[1:]] [A Goblin](https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goblin/)**

Action Economy per Turn:

*   30 ft. movement
*   Reliable Bonus Action
    Nimble Escape can be used to Disengage to improve their survivability or Hide to become an unseen attacker and improve their damage output.
    
*   1 Attack

**Verdict:** Slightly-Worse than the Control

Note: They have a comparable action economy to a low-level PC with only 1 attack per Action.

**Example [[2:]] [A Chimera](https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/monsters/chimera/)**

Action Economy per Turn:

*   Up to 60 ft. of total movement
    Flying speed
    
*   Three-attack Multiattack
    Fire Breath is a rechargeable AoE and part of this attack
    

**Verdict:** Better than the Control

**Now You’re an Action Economist!**

Understanding the action economy will open many doors for you to design better and more interesting encounters.

A proper assessment will find weak points in a creature’s action economy that you can fix by adding new elements to the battlefield, homebrewing legendary actions, or including other types of creatures in the encounter.

After all, combat becomes much deadlier when your party can’t innately outmaneuver their opponents.

**Activity — Calculate the Action Economy of an Ochre Jelly**

1.  Reference the Ochre Jelly statblock on pg. 243 of the Monster Manual or [in the SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)
2.  Assess the Ochre Jelly’s action economy
3.  Compare your assessment with the Control from this lesson

_Answer Key_

*   Movement: Detrimental
    20 ft slowerWhile it has 10 ft. of climbing speed & Spiderclimb, it still climbs slower than the Control
    
*   Actions - Detrimental
    It’s a single attack. Even though it deals respectable damage it can only target a single creature per turn.
    
*   Reaction - Bonus
    Unique reaction
    Lightning damage is rare, but slashing damage is common.
    It has a favorable chance to use its reaction most turns until the party stops attacking it with slashing weapons.
    
*   Overall: Worse Action Economy than the Control
    The ochre jelly only stands a chance against the Control if it can split itself multiple times during the encounter.
    

**How To Summary**

1.  Assess the creature’s movement
2.  Determine if the creature has a reliable Bonus Action
3.  Examine the creature’s unique action and Multiattack
4.  Take stock of any unique Reactions the creature may have
5.  If the creature is a powerful creature take their Legendary Actions and Lair actions into consideration
6.  Tally all of your assessments up and compare the creature with your Control
