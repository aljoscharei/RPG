1. Arratu wasteland. An area here was once xenoformed by the Outsiders into an environment hostile to humanity or one inhabited by dangerous alien lifeforms.
2. Canyons. A region with extensive canyons cut by rivers present or long-vanished. Make sure the rivers don’t climb after leaving them.
3. Grasslands. A broad sweep of savanna or grassy plains is a coherent whole here.
4. Jagged mountains. A new or re-sharpened mountain range forms a barrier in the region. The mountains are young, tall, and likely cast a substantial rain shadow.
5. Light forest. Interspersed with other terrain.
6. Pit. A Deep or some other underground megastructure collapsed and left a hole with a diameter measured in tens of miles.
7. Rocky hills. Rough and stony, with little arable land. Herding and raiding are the most profitable employments here.
8. Sand desert. This desert is a waste of sand and dunes. It may be from a rain shadow, or it might be a legacy of ancient war.
9. Swamp. A sinking river, lake margin, or wet coastal delta forms a vast bog in this flat land.
10. Weathered mountains. A significant skirt of hills is common. The rain shadow is likely limited due to the rounded, low mountains.
11. Ancient farmland. A huge stretch of land was re-engineered for optimal farming.
12. Blasted lands. Radioactive or scorched over by ancient war. Many ruins are likely.
13. Dense forest. Trackless, dark, and an effective natural barrier.
14. Islands. There’s a single significant island off the coast or an archipelago of some note
15. Jungle. A classic adventure-worthy jungle of wild, semi-alien flora and fauna.
16. Megaplex. The ruins of a single huge ancient structure stretch for endless miles.
17. Rain forest. Vast, damp, and green.
18. Rolling hills. A stretch of gently rolling hills makes for good agricultural land.
19. Scrub desert. These often appear on the leeward side of mountain ranges. Borders will often be grasslands or savanna.
20. Volcano. One or more mountains in a nearby range are volcanically active. This may be natural or it may be a consequence of Legacy flux or ancient manipulation.
