# FC5E3: The Three Round Combat Plan

**The Three Round Combat Plan**
It can be overwhelming sifting through all the creatures, actions, and spells come game night.
Skimming through your options mid-combat will save time, but this could mean misusing or forgetting to use an important action.
Fret not, there’s a solution that will alleviate both of these potential issues. All you need to do is add a three-round combat plan to your pre-game prep list.
**What’s a Three-Round Combat Plan?**
A three-round combat plan is a plan of attack for an encounter. In this plan, you’ll decide what your creatures should accomplish within the first three rounds of combat.
A successful three-round combat plan will save decision-making time, while also ensuring you make the proper choices while piloting your creatures.
**Before We Begin…**
Read through each creature’s stat block. Gain an understanding of what their strengths and weaknesses are as well as what they bring to the table.
As you complete your assessment, be on the lookout for MVP abilities.
An MVP ability is the encounter’s **most powerful Action or Spell** that will set the tone for the battle.
A rechargeable action is a dead giveaway for an MVP ability. These super powerful actions have limited uses, so it’s imperative you use them in the best situation possible.
Some encounters may not have an MVP ability, others may have multiple. Use your best judgment to decide what is or isn’t an MVP ability in your encounters.
If your encounter does not feature an MVP ability, follow the steps below for creating a three-round combat plan but skip the “Use or Setup for Your MVP Ability” section.
**Crafting a Three-Round Combat Plan**
A three-round combat plan requires us to consider the encounter’s battlefield. Assume best-case conditions given the environment.
Draw upon your player knowledge as you craft your plan. Consider their typical tactics and how to use your creatures to overturn their strategies.
Your creatures should synergize with each other as best they can. Make use of one creature’s strengths to bridge gaps in another creature’s weaknesses.
**Movement and Positioning**
Positioning is crucial in any combat scenario. Your creatures need to land clean blows on enemies while avoiding as much incoming damage as possible.
Consider your creatures’ positions at the beginning of the encounter.
Will they need to use a Dash Action to get into range, or is there scenery they could use to take cover behind as they advance upon the party?
Ranged attackers have more freedom in positioning themselves in comparison to melee attackers. Use their movement to position themselves away from the party’s melee combatants.
You could also utilize the battlefield’s natural cover and have ranged attackers duck in and out of cover between their attacks.
**Use or Setup for Your MVP Ability**
The MVP ability is the cornerstone of the encounter. Your goal is to squeeze as much value out of it as possible. How you accomplish this will vary based on what your MVP ability does.
Abilities that provide **utility** or **crowd control** should be used right away. The longer they are in use, the more value you get out of them.
**Rechargeable actions** should be used as soon as possible so creatures get more chances at recharging them throughout the fight _while still optimally using them._
For instance, AoE Actions should only be used if it hits 2+ targets. Whereas a single-target burst damage Action should be used on low AC or low HP targets to drop them quickly.
If you are unable to use your MVP ability on turn 1 you should prioritize having your creatures set up for the MVP ability to be used on a later turn.
Setup may involve repositioning your creature(s) with the MVP ability or using other creatures to damage, crowd control, or debuff potential targets.
**Spellcasters Can Bridge Gaps**
Spellcasters are a powerful tool in any encounter due to the variety of actions they bring to the table. Highlight their most useful spells to choose from come game time.
When you run the encounter, make use of their spell list by ad-libbing their turns so they provide utility, crowd control, or damage.
**Standard Attack Actions, Cantrips, and Multiattacks**
Now that we've got our foes in the best position to execute their MVP ability, rechargeable actions, or spells, it's time to attack.
Use your creatures’ standard Attack Actions, Multiattacks, and Cantrips when there are no better options to slot into your three-round combat plan.
**Rinse and Repeat**
Go through this priority list for each round of your three-round combat plan. Once you’ve planned a round, start from the top of the list and plan the next.
A three-round plan is sufficient. Three rounds of combat will set up the rest of the encounter and will be enough time to position and use your MVP ability at least once.
After the third round, you've set the combat in motion and you should have the foundational knowledge to continue making ideal choices for the rest of the encounter.
**Example: A Hard Encounter for an 8th Level Party of 4 PCs**
**Creatures**

*   1 x Half-Red Dragon Veteran — MVP ability: Fire Breath
*   3 x Berserkers

Their stat blocks are [in the SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) and the Monster Manual on pgs 180 & 344.
**My Three-Round Combat Plan**
**Round 1:** Barbarians attack whoever they can reach with Reckless or use a Dash Action to reach the party. If the half-red dragon veteran can hit 2+ PCs with _Fire Breath then use it instead of Multiattack._
**Round 2:** If the half-red dragon veteran’s _Fire Breath_ recharges use it on +2 targets. Otherwise, use _Multiattack._ The berserkers close-in on poorly-armored PCs or whoever they can reach. Attack with _Reckless_ to increase their chance to hit.
**Round 3:** Repeat Round 2.
**Now that the Preparations are Complete…**
A three-round combat plan gives you a succinct reference for running your encounters. Drafting one will save game time and ensure you make the most of your creatures.
Identify your MVP ability and consider how you can use all of your creatures to set it up and turn the tide of battle in your favor.
The first three rounds of an encounter are crucial. Use them well and you’ll set your creatures up for success.

**Worksheet Activity - Make a Three-Round Combat Plan**
Make a three-round combat plan for an encounter for a 5-person 11th-level party using the following creatures:

*   1 x Vampire
*   1 x Vampire Spawn

Their Statblocks are [in the SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) or the Monster Manual on pgs 297 & 298.
**_Answer Key:_**
_Due to the number of options the Vampire has, people may come up with different three-round combat plans. Remember this is a plan and plans can change._
**MVP Abilities:** Vampire’s Children of the Night and Charm
**Round 1:** Vampire uses Children of the Night. Use their legendary actions for movement and grapple a PC with their claw attacks. Vampire Spawn uses their claws to grapple at least 1 target.
**Round 2:** Use the Vampire’s _Charm_ on a high damage-dealing target to CC them. Continue to claw and bite with Legendary actions. Continue to have the Vampire Spawn bite their grappled target or grapple a target with their claw attack.
**Round 3:** Continue attacking the grappled PCs and charming high-damage targets each round. Direct your swarm of bats/rats/wolves to attack grappled targets when they arrive.
**How To Summary**

1.  Position your creatures.
2.  Set up and use the MVP ability.
3.  Have your spellcasters provide damage, utility, and crowd control as needed.
4.  Use standard Attack Actions.
5.  Rinse and repeat to plan three rounds of combat.
