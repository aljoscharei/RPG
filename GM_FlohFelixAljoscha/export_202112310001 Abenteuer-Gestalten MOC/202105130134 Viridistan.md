Annotation summary:

\--- Page 1 ---

Note (yellow):
0307 Pernicus, Lake (Calm Aquatic, Underwater; EL 12): Lake Pernicus is a dangerous area; heavily armed cavemen are found in large groups, protecting the silver they trans-port to trade. Thieves and brigands roam the southeastern banks and areas south along the Sharryn River. Demons inhabit the mountains north of the lake, umber hulks live to the west, lizardfolk live in the lake and salamanders live in the hills southwest of the lake. It is said to be the old home to a demigod named Pernicus, whose temple lies deep beneath the surface. Encounters: cavemen, demons, lizard men, umber hulks

Note (yellow):
0409 Pinnacle Mountains (Forbidding Mountains, high peak): Tricky mountain passes and unsafe mines discourage all but the Elphan cavemen from entering these dangerous mountains. The cavemen work various mines throughout the region. The Skandiks believe that the highest peak of the Pinnacles is the earthly end of the Rainbow Bridge leading to Asgard. Most sages believe that this is within the Kingdom of Karak, though no hero has ever seen the bridge at either location. The silver ore is carried out by secret tunnel to Lake Pernicus south of Stukwrak where the cavemen are paid in venison, mutton and ale. Brigands give trouble between Yrahm Jakupda and the Sharryn River; thieves try trickery at most points from Shimmertree Vale to Glint Valley, but outright attacking the military escort guarding the ore is unwise for most outlaw bands. Wyverns are said to nest in an abandoned silver mines. One mine collapsed many decades back due to vicious birds attacking the timbers (some say it was due to the tiny sawtooth maggot worm).

Note (yellow):
0513 Hurpy Scarp (Forbidding Mountain, high peak): High, craggy mountain, lair of many dangerous creatures. Encounters: harpies, griffons, perytons

Note (yellow):
0416 Dead Queens, Valley of the (Grasslands, EL 16): Long ago, this valley was home to a matriarchal hunter-gatherer society, ruled over by three queens. For countless ages the valley was peaceful, but eventually the queens Nandi, Varanna and Melusina disagreed on the use of their queenly powers and fought continuously, greatly harming the people. Some tales paint a far darker picture, claiming that the three queens and their predecessors were infected with vampirism and that their evil grew with each successive generation. One day a stranger appeared in court, a female stranger who made a terrible prophecy and not long hence this prophecy came to pass. The land was cleft by a mighty earthquake and the queens were buried in the debris. The beautiful young princesses withered and shrank, becoming misshapen. They died young and all their progeny were hideous, dying young as well. Another story claims that the valley was cursed with a fire-spell that prevents the undead from leaving, and that the queens' vampiric descendants are still there, trapped in a magical prison. It is hard to confirm these tales, for today, the valley is inhabited by all manner of the most hideous of monsters. For this reason most all creatures avoid this area, in spite hushed words about the great amount of treasure in the valley. Only those strong or foolhardy enough to take it by force should contemplate any attempts at retrieving it. Dark tales speak of a palace deep in the valley where the vampire queens' progeny and their handmaidens are imprisoned, subsisting on rats and other small animals, and growing more vengeful with each passing century. Encounters: chimerae, gargoyles, hezrou demons, medusae, purple worms, trolls, vampires

Note (yellow):
0225 Berserker Wilds (Grasslands, EL 6): This region is named for both its wild inhabitants and for a plant that is common to the area that exudes a gas affecting all mammals. After inhaling this gas, creatures become enraged and blood-thirsty. The berserkers of the region inhale the stuff before battle, often turning on each other once their foes have been defeated. There are two major tribal groups, the chaotic evil Northern Berserkers and the neutral Southern Berserkers. The northerners hunt in the plains west of Selisengard and the hills west of Crystal Lake, seeking game, monsters, travelers and luckless Southern Berserkers. The southerners prefer to be left in peace, though they are not overtly hostile and will talk to strangers before deciding whether to be violent. Each tribe has a great golden idol worth 10,000 gp as well as fine, sturdy horses, but little else of value. The only thing that unites the two groups is a shared hatred of orcs and goblins. Occasionally one group or the other launches raids into the Emperor's lands, though in the end these invasions always collapse and are defeated by the Viridian military. Encounters: barbarians, goblins, orcs

Note (yellow):
0331 Bestial Barrens (Grasslands): The barrens are inhabited only by monsters and gnomes — most men, elves, and dwarves avoid this area if possible unless well protected. Poisonous dire toads with powerful tongues, giant lizards, rattlesnakes, three-legged runner birds that stun large prey with loud screams, and slithering prickles make this wilderness unpleasant for travelers. Wherever prickles gather, there will be a vein of valuable metal or crystal not far underground. A large rock near Ezrahaddon has a strange paw with hooked claws carved out of it. The claws retract when the rock is approached but that is all that has ever happened (up until now). Also native to the Barrens is a unique species of aromatic plant, which when eaten has effects similar to catnip. Even the most gigantic and aggressive of creatures become quite playful if they consume some of the plant, though a playful lion or bear can still be dangerous. Dragons have even been seen harvesting the plant.

Note (yellow):
0527 Saffrin, Lake (Calm Aquatic): A calm and picturesque lake that is nonetheless the center of considerable activity and mystery, from the ruins of Selisengard to the strange creature known as the Lady of the Lake and a hostile grig fey who hangs her victims from trees. The village of Saimon is located at the southern tip of the lake. Encounters: badgers, bears, deer, fox

Note (yellow):
0523 Crystal Lake (Calm Aquatic): The Crystal Lake area is infested with orcs. The lake itself is a clear pure blue and contains no unsavory creatures. The fish are large and tasty, the scenery idyllic and access difficult. The bed of the lake is said to be strewn with geodes and multi-colored crystals, though a species of freshwater jellyfish sometimes swarms in the depths, making collecting the crystals difficult. Orcs throw small stones into the lake while making wishes, believing the lake to be magical. Goat heads embellishing the ends of long earth-embedded poles surround the lake every 50 feet.

Note (yellow):
0421 Glass Mountain (Rugged Mountains, high peak): This highest peak in the southern Starrcrags could just as well be called orc mountain, for its slopes teem with these brutal creatures, who maintain mines in the region. Encounters: dire wolves, orcs

Note (yellow):
1201 Eleph Territories (Grasslands): Home to a backward people who disdain modern tools and weapons, although they must use them on a rotating basis under terms of a treaty with the Green Emperor. Highly empathic with wild horses, they supply most of Viridistan's needs and make their homes in huge caverns. Encounters: barbarians, coyotes, wild horses, Elphan cavemen

Note (yellow):
1910 Glint Valley (Gentle Hills): Across the river to the west of the town of Oonsla is Glint Valley. Located between the Firelock Hills to the north and the Brotbuckle Hills to the south, Glint Valley is a peaceful spot protected by the Sharryn and Flee Rivers. Further, Paladin Caelearak (male human Pal14; CR 14; hp 77; Str 18, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 20; spell resistance 15 full plate +3, holy avenger longsword) and his devoted friends are the sole residents of the valley. All those with peaceful intentions are welcome. Caelearak and company will gladly accompany guests in need of help if he can be convinced the main purpose is to destroy evil rather than to merely capture treasure. That is not to say, of course, that he wouldn't want his fair cut of anything found. Encounters: bears, deer, smilodons

Note (yellow):
1808 Eagol Ruins (Rugged Hills): This region is dotted with ruined walls, burial mounds and other remnants of an ancient civilization. Caves, caverns and ancient dungeons can be found throughout the region. Barroom tales and rumor claim that ancient treasures and artifacts are here for the taking, though other rumors speak of powerful undead and guardian demons that protect the loot.

Note (yellow):
1408 Sharryn River (Calm Aquatic): Named for a fey demi-goddess also called the spirit of roses, this river often turns pink in the fall. It is believed that bathing in the river's waters at twilight will cure lycanthropy, but only those who were of non-evil alignment before contracting the disease.

Note (yellow):
1411 Shimmertree Vale (Grasslands): Shimmertree has a high percentage of birches and aspens and oaks. Several dryads live in the vale. A large variety of fire breathing praying mantis inhabits the valley (see below), the only known effective enemy to the buzzing lapsuckers, a pest to humans and animals alike. The mantises make good pets. A herd of tiny horses runs wild in the valley. They are said to know the Way to the Gods. ^ShimmertreeVale

Note (yellow):
1815 Ming River (Calm Aquatic): This river was named for an ancient sorcerer who was exiled to the Demon Empire and became Emperor of Pain. He is said to still live somewhere in the region, punishing anyone who swears fealty to any demon lord who disobeyed his benefactor. A mischievous creature, half-fey and half-elf, is also said to inhabit the Ming, living with his nymph wife near the waterfalls feeding this river, but sightings of this strange being have been few and contradictory.

Note (yellow):
1720 Kendhras River (Calm Aquatic): Named for a legendary Amazon Pirate who once used the river as her base of operations, the stone drydock is crumbling and no explorer has ever found her buried treasure. The rotting hulk of a warship with the skeleton a giant sea snake wrapped many times about the ship is often seen at low tide near the mouth of the river.

Note (yellow):
1421 Missing Memory Marshes (Swamp, EL 14): Home to the friendly but dangerous Smirge the Eel, the Missing Memory Marshes are a perilous place for inexperienced travelers. There is only one completely dry path all the way through the marshes, known only by a few. The fog and the drooping moss makes everything look the same and it is easy to get lost, go crazy, and circle for weeks before the end comes, usually with the victims shocked senseless by the playful Smirge. Successfully finding one's way through this morass requires making a DC 20 Survival check. ^MissinMemoryMarshes

Note (yellow):
1024 Amber Ford (Calm Aquatic): South of treacherous swamps of Smirge the Eerie Eel, the Amber Ford crosses the Chekulon River along a major trade route

Note (yellow):
0923 Spire Falls (Stormy Aquatic): Short but rushing waterfall, the Spire Falls are a mere 50ft high, but the force of the river causes the falls to arc nearly half that distance when falling.

Note (yellow):
0818 Headspring (Rough Aquatic): This rough, glacier-fed river tumbles down form the Starrcrags and flows through the Missing Memory Marshes before joining the Kendhras River near Mishell.

Note (yellow):
0927 Slithytove (Dense Woods/Swamp): Slithytove Woods is not exactly swamp, but it is usually mushy. It is known for its vermin, snakes, leeches and slimy worms that writhe in the mud. The woods are usually choked with a thick, fog-like vapor. There is little grass except for tough swamp grass and pampas. The trees are mostly gnarled softwoods called gongo trees. The mud rocks are said to move. The region is named for a local predatory snake and is also believed to be the home of a notorious leprechaun and his herd of pet jackalopes.

Note (yellow):
0717  Starrcrag Mountains (Forbidding Mountains, low peak/ high pass, EL 15): An insular and somewhat xenophobic clan of red-bearded mountain dwarves lives in the Starrcrags. The spirit of the highest peak in these moun-tains often appears as a 60-foot, twinkling star. Any wayfarer will be asked a riddle. Correct answers result in instant knowledge of the path across the peaks and incorrect answers result in a torrential storm with violent winds that make further progress impossible for one full day. Encounters: dwarves, giant eagles, prospectors, storm giants

Note (yellow):
1012 Flee, River (Calm Aquatic, Busy): Drawing from the southern fork of the Sharryn, the River Flee is a long stretch flowing through Tell Qa and around the Shimmertree Vale, draining into the Valley of the Dead Queens.

Note (yellow):
2205 Zirzus Plain (Grasslands): This region was named for an explorer from the region who claimed that he had been brought to Mount Olympus by Aphrodite. The scruff and scrub blanketing the Zirzus Plain supports several herds of wild horses, as well as such exotic creatures as three-legged runner birds (see Bestial Barrens entry), giant lizards and blink dogs. Deadly beholders have been seen on the plains, along with infestations of wererats. Some inhabitants report seeing creatures that resemble the noble lammasu. A few hardy settlers maintain farmsteads, and long-abandoned outposts dot the region.

Note (yellow):
2103 Bone Hollow (Rocky Desert): Bone Hollow is a horse-shoe-shaped valley surrounded by hills all around except on the south. The floor of the valley is smooth rock and rubble with no vegetation of any kind. Here are the barrows of many ancient warlords who fell in combat with the ancients. In the very middle of the valley is a fumarole where a skeletal apparition appears four or five times a night. The skeleton utters extremely wise and learned utterances, and its advice should always be followed. Ob-servers can ask questions of the skeleton, but there is only a 1% chance that they will be answered. About 40% of the skeleton's messages are warnings, 30% are per-sonal advice and 30% are general helpful in-formation.

Note (yellow):
2214 Brotbuckle Briars (Moor): A particularly bad area of wild bushes covered with thorns. Predators venturing into this dangerous maze often go mad trying to find their way out again. Wolves are known to roam this area, using briars for shelter and protection. Legend holds that the bushes were enchanted long ago to keep intruders away from an ancient shrine that is said to lie near the center of the region. They are said to actually move and close behind travelers. Encounters: snakes (small vipers), wolves

2418 Ghan River (Rough Aquatic): Kobolds are common just west of Leafork. Giant centipedes infest the forest near Shilly Shallows. Encounters: giant centipedes, kobolds

Note (yellow):
2408 Pebble Straits (Calm Aquatic, Busy): These shallows are one of the best-known fords of the placid Sharryn River. Traffic to and from the nearby settlement of Oonsla is common. 

2508 Pebble Straits: Just east of the “pitchfork” of the Sharryn river, the Pebble Straits are a run of very rocky and churning waters.

Note (yellow):
2611 Stay Falls (Stormy Aquatic, EL 19): A little ways upstream of Ruppin Athuk, a beautiful awe-inspiring waterfall reflects the morning sun off a rock that conceals a secret door to wealth and magical treasures belonging to a once famous powerful magician (now said to be a lich!). A large crystal shrine reflects a beam of light once a year on the door to illumine the opening device. Water from the pool of Stay Falls that touches the shrine will heal curses and neutralize evil spells of the Transformation school. ^ViridistanLich

Note (yellow):
2710

Note (yellow):
2523 Elsenwood (Dense Forest, EL 12): This enclave of wood elves is ruled by the brothers Splendulin and Efrinodel. Tightly controlled by the wood elves, Elsenwood remains wild, primitive and, for outsiders, very dangerous. The elves are highly insular and xenophobic – intruders such as powerful magic users or invading armies sometimes find themselves dancing in the forest hundreds of years, while others are simply incapacitated and transported out with warnings never to return. The elves are about five feet tall, slender, fleet of foot and have the balance of acrobats. One will never see them in the wood until it is too late, for the silvery green raiment they wear aids them in eluding others.

Note (yellow):
2327 Utscur Bogs (Swamp): Disease infested wetland, the Utscur bogs are home to the wicked Swilon trolls. They hide the famous magical windrider bronze horse, statues of gold, and the ancient art of King Dellar the Stellar. The region is treacherous and its terrain constantly changes. Many a once-living beast and human are perfectly preserved in the tricky, shifting peat. Encounters: giant insects, trolls, leeches, oozes and jellies

Note (yellow):
2727 Vapor Hills (Gentle Hills): These hills release trace amounts of methane gases. Bearing a torch in the area has a 40% chance of igniting a gas pocket per hour, causing 4d6 points of fire damage to all in a 15 ft. radius.

Note (yellow):
2628 Phouth Bogs (Swamp): These lowlands between the Soppy Hills and the Vapor Hills are mucky and stagnant, filled with filthy runoff from the Shorn River. They are said to contain many personal treasures of the lost Kings of Crown Knoll. Giant snapping turtles hunt in the bogs and clouds of mosquitoes carry disease.

Note (yellow):
2530 Soppy Hills (Gentle Hills): Wet and soft, the Soppy Hills are vast peat mounds covered is loose grasses and weak earth. Purple worms have burrows under the hills. Bullettes and ankheg are also sometimes encountered.

Note (yellow):
2331 Eba Aba, Plain of (Grasslands): This windy plain is nothing but grasses and heather with an occasional coppice of wildwood. About 40% of the copses have a treasure chest buried in them 10 to 20 feet below the surface with treasure worth 10 to 1,000 gp. Not many have been found due to the amount of digging required, the booby traps, the uncertainty of the amount of worth to be uncovered and the fact there are no maps to these treasures. The bones of ancient warriors, horses and orcs are tangled in the sod. The grasses are infested with giant ticks and disease carrying rats. There is a legend about the lost King of Eba Aba who found a roc's egg that controlled all the genies of the world. He collected all the rings, lamps, and other vessels that contained genies and buried them in a hidden booby-trapped cave on his plain. All the genies, that is, except one. The constant winds on the Plain of Eba Aba are said to be echoes of the king's lost spirit roaming the world searching for the last genie, which is said to be buried in a brass bottle somewhere on the plains, awaiting its release filled with desire for vengeance. Encounters: giant ticks, rats, wild dogs, ghosts

Note (yellow):
2806 Snikle, River (Calm Aquatic): Running along the west side of the Marmon Mist, the Snikle is home to giant lizards and wild swamp goblins.

Note (yellow):
3207 Marmon Mist (Swamp, EL 15): This vast and dismal swamp, dreaded for its dangerous predators, is located between the Rivers Mush and Snikle, and is best known as the lair of the Three Witches of Marmon. It is also known to harbor fearsome grey renders and primitive tribes of lizard folk.

Note (yellow):
3405 Mush, River (Calm Aquatic): A dirty, murky river, the Mush slowly oozes its way from the Sharryn River into the Iso Monster Lake.

Note (yellow):
3509 Quessen River (Calm Aquatic): A branch of the Sharryn River, the Quessen flows slowly through the hills into Demon Valley.

Note (yellow):
4312 Stickthorn River (Calm Aquatic): Named for a trouble-some thorn bush lining its banks, both the Upper and Lower branches of this river have excellent fishing. Wild boars roam the hills round about and large crystals (suitable for crystal balls) can be found in and under the bed of the Upper Stickthorn.

Note (yellow):
3920 Targnol Plains (Grasslands): Named for a king who died in battle here long ago, the plains are abundant with animal life. Antelope, wooly buffalo and other game animals thrive in this grassy region. The area is rich in flowers and grasses because of its many freshwater springs. The plains are filled with gnolls, who mostly keep to themselves and kill game. There are several Wights that live in the many beach mounds that lie along the coastal road. The wights desire only to add to their unhappy number. Use of the coastal road is not advisable without magical weapons. Encounters: wights, gnolls, dire wolves

Note (yellow):
4017 Thistledown (Medium Forest, EL 8): Thistledown is good logging country, not being protected by elves. The forest is full of thistle and cottonwood trees and in the spring the region's fairies love to float through the air on the wind-blown seedlings. A being called Faedoom is said to inhabit the forest and protects the fairies, visiting destruction on all those who harm them. The great threat of the forest is a creature called Koses (his lair is at hex 3815). Encounters: fey (mostly debased and evil, a few good), satyr, other sylvan creatures, many of which have turned to evil in order to resist the encroachment of humans, Koses

Note (yellow):
4417 Rock Falls (Rough Aquatic): Series of short drops along the Hyando, the rock falls are home to very short bugbears. Encounters: bugbears

Note (yellow):
4415 Hyando River (Rough Aquatic): The Hyando River is a fast, rocky, deep, narrow river that has no bridges over it. Crossings are possible upriver where the river is still a stream (e.g., the East Fork Crossing), at Balicur Crossing (a shallows) and Tessell Wade, near the mouth. Its rapids foam ferociously and are said to reach out and grab anyone who gets close. Caves along the river provide shelter for travelers and hideouts for brigands.

Note (yellow):
4326 Gheulost Island: A legend exists about this island that has become “fact” in the local area. Many years ago, when the earth was dark and the sea bubbled red, there were no islands, no safe places for the sea people to safely cool their scales among the rocks. Large ferocious animals roamed the beaches and fed in the shallow waters. One day, a little sea boy, while cooling himself on a floating sea friend plant, was caught in a whirlpool and dragged down into the seething red mud at the bottom of the sea. The little boy was stuck and hot red mud clogged his gills. Then he felt under his fingers a large metal ring, the Sea Cradle Plug, and he pulled. All the world shuddered. Then the little sea boy was spewed far into the air and it rained red mud. He swam to the sea friend plant for protection but it stung him and stung him, for the water was cooling and it was distressed. Alas, the little sea boy sank beneath the waters and died. The waters cooled. The red mud turned to rock and many islands were formed. Warmth came from the skies instead of from the sea and so the sea people now warm themselves on the rocks instead of cool themselves. But they still avoid the main lands for men had replaced the ferocious animals. The sea friend plant is now called sea enemy. The red rock is carbelium (see 3125). The little sea boy was named Gheu. The island that was formed where the little boy was last seen is known as Gheulost. And the sea enemy plant, like islands near which the sea people dwell are called Tric and Trac, for between the islands they keep track of tricky stinging plants. This island is a major strategic resource for the emperor, and is heavily guarded and garrisoned at all times. It is the world's only source of carbelium, a magical red metal that has anti-metallic properties. One or two warships guard Gheulost Island at all times, and several hundred soldiers are stationed on the island. It is death to land here. Shir, Silver Cove and Shore are permanent army camps with one tavern each and several barracks and gaming rooms. No one but military personnel and miners (mostly Elphans) are permitted on the island. The oyster pearl beds all around the island need some protection, too. Mere Lake is good fishing but there is said to be several wights in the Volk Mountains. Miners occasionally disappear in these mountains (due to the wights)

Note (yellow):
4511 Gigabolt Mountains (Forbidding Mountains, high peak; EL 16): These mountains are known for their terrible storms that feed the angry Hyando River, and also for being dangerous country where druids and medusae live. The druids manage in such poor company by hiding and avoiding the snake-headed women. The gifts of communication with plants and animals are helpful here. The druids periodically make themselves scarce, especially just prior to and during times of political upheaval. Chaotic evil creatures are unwelcome here, either because of some ancient battle spell or because of the very spirit of the mountains, for many chaotic evil beings that enter the mountains are slain by mysterious lightning bolts (being lawful evil, the medusae remain relatively safe). Black dire wolves with huge whirling red eyes roam in packs protecting the ancient gathering places, magical stone circles and long burrows in the hills south of Gigabolt Mountains. Silvery fires called the Pyrngol Lights seen at night in this area denote buried treasure or an evil being. Several hell hound lairs are near the Pyrngol Lights

Note (yellow):
4514 Eddyroll Spout (Stormy Aquatic, Perilous): Eddyroll Spout is a spray of water that shoots up 50 feet in the air due to the force of both forks coming together and the rock formations there. Slippery conditions might make one lose their footing (40% chance) and leeches and other vermin nibble legs and feet. The Eddyroll is watched over by the druids of the Gigabolt for some unknown reason.

Note (yellow):
4515 Smitch Chasm (Rugged Mountains, low pass): Deep gulch located in the Brigand Hills, the Senitch is a favored and protected spot for local thugs to hide themselves from the law.

Note (yellow):
3426 Emperor Farmlands (Farmlands): The Green Emperor owns and controls much land used for farming purposes. Slaves and serfs work much of the Emperor's farmlands but he also receives a 15% tax on freeman fields. There is some continual tension in the supervision of all these lands as Shah Satyrbis insists the freeman fields are his responsibility as well as smaller fields closer to Caer Cadwen. The fact that the black boggy soil along the Shorn River is much richer than the lighter soil of the Emperor Farmlands might have something to do with this on-going squabble. Good farmland is at a premium throughout the empire as it is rare. Encounters: farmers, Viridian soldiers, merchants

Note (yellow):
3526 Serf Terrace (Farmlands): Peasants who dwell in these northeastern plantations work year round, rotating crops to make efficient use of the poor soil.

Note (yellow):
3423 Holy Mounds (Grasslands): This plain contains flower-covered burial mounds raised ages ago by a passing Mycretian army to bury their most beloved heroes. Animals avoid the mounds and sentient creatures have been known to fall into a deep coma lasting up to 30 days if they tread upon the flowers. The elves of Elsenwood have no special use for the area but allow Mycretians to gather there whenever they wish. Encounters: cave lions, wooly rhinoceros, wild ponies

Note (yellow):
3002 Iso Monster Lake (Calm Aquatic, EL 20+): This lake is home to a legendary and ravenous monster that will attack any creature that comes near. The creature (or creatures) remains submerged below the surface of the lake, but occa-sionally sends many long tentacles to snare flying creatures or creatures near to the shore. It is said that the Iso Monster has even snared low-flying dragons. Birds and animals avoid the lake, preferring the swamps to the south or the Ayes Sanctuary to the east. Even the Marmon Witches do not venture here, which is a testament to the power of the creature. Encounters: mermen, nixies, river trolls, water elementals, the Iso Monster (run for your lives!)

Note (yellow):
3128 Leander, River (Rough Aquatic): The River Leander is a wide, fast and dangerous river from its mouth by Viridistan up to Leafork. Except for the narrow but sturdy bridge by the City, Shilly Shallows is the only other reliable crossing on the river. Though it is known to be treacherous in many places, the Leander is nonetheless a beautiful sight, for it sparkles with light both night and day. Some say that this is caused by some species of glowing water insect, while more romantic souls believe that miniature fey known as leandris are responsible, but no one has actually ever seen one. The suspension bridge between Leafork and Caer Cadwen is in constant and repeated states of disrepair and is not safe for caravans or carts, forcing them to detour via Rock Haven. Between Caer Cadwen and Rock haven live kobolds and treants just west of Leafork.

Note (yellow):
3929 Cesspin Boggs (Swamp): Wights patrol these soggy areas, under the control of a wicked genie lord. The Cesspin Bogs contain the treasures of the lost civilization of the Chryezetil Lindemos.

Note (yellow):
3131 Shorn River (Calm Aquatic, Underwater): A strong coastal river, the Shorn slows down at Cesspin Boggs, and comes to a halt at the Phouth bogs. Lacedons travel this river from the coast.

Note (yellow):
2931 Muck Bourn (Calm Aquatic): Muddy, slow branch of the Shorn river

Note (yellow):
3229 Freeman Fields (Farmlands): Independent and self reliant farmers here refuse allegiance to any lord. The farmers are occasionally plagued by outbreaks of lycanthropy; the last of these outbreaks was over a century ago, and resulted in the region being granted its current independent state.

Note (yellow):
3621 Sae Laamer, Kingdom of: The merfolk of the Trident Gulf have a long and troubled history that dates back before even the beginnings of the Viridian people. Sae Laamer, the rich and beautiful abode of the merfolk is located deep in the treacherous sea between the islands of Tric and Trac. Its ruler, Queen Deleamaka (see 3228) dreamed of re-establishing the years of freedom that her people had under the Viridian emperors Riddisorn and Cneninadus, but her plans were frustrated when the merfolk's powerful amulet of Khetren fell into the hands of the evil god Armadad Bog. Today, the merfolk of Sae Laamer are subject to Armadad Bog's will, and Deleamaka is desperate to see her people freed. Deleamaka has even approached the World Emperor, leader of the Mer Shunna cult that worships Armadad Bog, begging for the return of the amulet. Unfortunately for Deleamaka, the emperor would prefer to keep her for his harem rather than offend his deity by asking for the amulet back, and she is currently planning to return to Sae Laamer, though the emperor may not let her. She currently resides in one of the mermaid tanks under the Imperial Palace. Sae Laamer remains a jewel of ancient merfolk art and architecture, housing over 400 merfolk (CR 1/2, hp 6 each). The settlement's standing military force consists of 32 merfolk warriors (War1-3), 12 merfolk officers (Ftr1-3) and 24 shark tenders (Ftr1/Rg3) who have tamed a school of 18 large sharks (CR 2, hp 38 each) that aid them in battle. In the queen's absence, the kingdom is ruled by her daughter Chael (female merfolk Ari3/Clr5; CR 7; hp 26; AL LG; Str 12, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 19; +2 trident, amulet of natural armor +3). Her brother Ethuel (male merfolk Ari3/Ftr4; CR 6; hp 29; AL LE; Str 18, Dex 12, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 8, Cha 17; +3 heavy crossbow) is jealous of the attention paid his sister and contemplates taking the throne himself if their mother fails to return. The merfolk are compelled to participate in Armadad Bog's bloody rituals and their hope for freedom fades with each passing day.

Note (yellow):
3628 Villain Cliffs (Rugged Mountains, low peak/high pass): The first major landmark seen by travelers sailing toward Viridistan, the Villain Cliffs were named by ship captains from the past upon dealing with the World Emperor. Arch criminals are sometimes hung from the cliffs to die.

Note (yellow):
3428 Nereus Firth (Calm Aquatic): This inlet of the River Leander is known for its rich fishing grounds, and also for its seasonal explosions of sea-worms, which gives the region its name

Note (yellow):
3926 Trident Gulf (Rough Aquatic, Busy, Underwater): Choppy but relatively shallow body of water between the City State and Ghuelost Island. Naval ships of the World Emperor are on heavy patrol here and any unfamiliar ships are attacked with war machines and magic and destroyed on sight. The merfolk of Sae Laamer are also sometimes encountered.

Note (yellow):
4722 Salmo, Cape (Grasslands): This cape is often called the Helm for the shape of its headland rocks. It teems with shorebirds and citrus trees, and so is a welcome stopover for low-provisioned ships and a good place to look out for pirates.

Note (yellow):
5023 Hoary Mountains (Forbidding Mountains, high pass/ low peak, Cold): Unusually chilly year-round, these peaks are always covered with snow. Mountain sheep of the Hoary Mountain peaks provide the warmest wool avail-able. It is quite valuable. They are hard to catch and shear and impossible to tame. Sapamas and alpacas, easier to catch and tame, are more numerous and their wool is light and soft. Mountain men trade these products in Grimlon for staples. A herd of mammoths is said to dwell in the mountains but frost giants hunt there too. Bugbears haunt the foothill valleys. Great herds of musk deer roam higher elevations. Somewhere in the Hoary mountains lies the Valley of Diamonds, accessible only by bird, which is said to have made a few enterprising men wealthy (not many know this valley's existence). Encounters: bugbears, frost giants, mammoths, mountain lions, sheep, snow leopards

Note (yellow):
5124 Buckol, River (Calm Aquatic): Originating in the Hoary mountains, the river Buckol flows through the Grimlon Outlands deeper into the lands of the Imperial Overlord.

Note (yellow):
5027  Bitter Ridge (Rugged Mountains, low peak/high pass, EL 13): This long narrow range of small mountains is relatively easy to traverse, though the land is practically barren. The land seems cursed and has a long history of bad luck that falls upon people here. Bitter Ridge is a place of lost loves, failed dreams, last straws, foiled plans, double-crosses, frustrated last hopes, rekindled hates and terrible deaths. The entire area radiates a luck penalty of –4. As if this was not enough, Bitter Ridge is inhabited by a particu-larly loathsome species of giant flea that feeds on bears and antelopes. A caped apparition known as the Lost Rider is said to gallop gallops through the hills and mountains on a nightmare, dropping realistic-looking false treasure maps and changing road markers.

Note (yellow):
4829 Nho River (Calm Aquatic, Busy): Originating near the coastal town of Nho, the Nho River flows deeply into Bitter Ridge.

Note (yellow):
5030 Bitter End (Rugged Hills): The southern end of Bitter Ridge is especially desolate and rugged, with very little in the way of vegetation and native species

Note (yellow):
4817 Ladd River (Calm Aquatic): Bordering the Thistle-down forests eastern edge, the Ladd river is a wide, shallow waterway bisecting the Brigand Hills.

Note (yellow):
4815 Brigand Hills (Gentle Hills): Low rolling hills, the area is made up of switchbacks and maze-like mesas used for the lawless to run from authorities. Humanoids are common here. Encounters: halflings, goblins, orcs

Note (yellow):
4312 Druid Hold (Rugged Hills): A high hill near the Gigabolt Mountains, Druid Hold is an ancient ring of 32 stones. Each of the massive granite stones is covered in runes of religious and magical nature. Strange lights dance above the stones when seen from far away. It is said that a stronghold of caves and carved passages lies beneath the ancient monoliths.

Note (yellow):
4009 Demon Valley (Alpine Meadow, EL 13): There are no habitations or visible structures in Demon Valley. The beautiful meadows and small copses of trees seem an idyllic setting but for the large crag of rock in the middle of the valley that is actually a doorway to the underworld. Unsavory creatures on rare occasions meet here for unmentionable activities as well as using the Black Gate for passage between worlds. Encounters: basilisks, demons, ghouls, hags, specters

Note (yellow):
4311 Yahg Khosha (Rocky Desert, EL 18): Extremely rough country of brambles, ravines, clefts and caves of rock, large craggy hills and loose rubble, Yahg Khosha is the ancient home of balor demons. There are many here still, it is said, though it more likely to encounter demonic activity in the mountains further southeast, where there is supposed to be an evil temple. Other reported denizens are strange half-man, half-yak creatures, but no firm evidence of their existence has yet been obtained. Encounters: evil outsiders, fire elementals, salamanders

Note (yellow):
4313 Balicur Crossing: This dwarven-made stone bridge allows passage over the western arm of the Hyando River.

Note (yellow):
3810 Rakshashas (Gentle Hills, EL 13): Many gnomes and a few rugged halflings make their home in the Rakshasas wilderness, accounting for the mines and burrows that cover this area. Encounters: dwarves, halflings, hill giants

Note (yellow):
3808 Tanngrisner (Gentle Hills, EL 15): This hidden valley is named for its most famous inhabitant, an aged monk who leads a group of other ascetics in the creation of teas, infusions and potions. It is a beautiful and untamed place, and hostile outsiders often find themselves unexpectedly transported elsewhere.

Note (yellow):
5211 South Mantle (Grasslands): A broken wall spans the main pass but the gate was breached ages ago, and smaller ruins dot the region. Huge boulders worked into smooth spheres are found near the ruins. While locals claim that these are the kidney stones of titans, others suspect that they were simply the siege weapons of giants.

Note (yellow):
5104 North Mantle (Rugged Mountain, high pass/low peak): Once considered the best defense for the plains below, the passes though this rough terrain contain ruined frontier forts. The forts have long since been plundered of valu-ables, but stories tell of a weird moaning that echoes through the passes if anyone tries to find any lost treasures.

Note (yellow):
5106 Bendigroth, Plateau of (Battlefield): Once a prosperous area, this area was deemed ungodly when disease decimated its population. Travelers sometimes shelter in the ruins of villas but avoid the area's many graves, which are always covered with dark moldy grass. It is said that the region is cursed since a great battle of six armies once took place here, and the unquiet spirits of the slain still lurk on the plains, responsible for the illness and misfortune of those who venture here. Encounters: ghosts, wights, wraiths

Note (yellow):
The Nest of Vipers (Grasslands): A beautiful meadow at the southeast edge of Slithytove Woods. The lushness of this area acts as a verdant trap, attracting animals and other unsuspecting victims to this den of hundreds of large, poisonous vipers. Viper fangs usually bring 20 gp each, while their poison can fetch 10 gp per drop, but only from the proper buyers. Yuan ti have also been sighted here. Some tales suggest that fearsome creatures called inphidians may be here as well, working with the Yuan ti to some diabolic purpose. Encounter: inphidians, snakes (large vipers or gaboon vipers), yuan ti

Note (yellow):
4306 Feather Shoals (Calm Aquatic, Busy): Named for the many aquatic birds that nest in the area, Feather Shoals is also the major fishing grounds for the villagers of Feigh.

Note (yellow):
4403 Lalyn Estuary (Calm Aquatic, busy): The inlet to the Sharryn river is a nesting ground for many water fowl as well as a favored fishing area, said to contain huge clam beds. A standing stone carved with ancient letters of the Kelnorian language says Meridian Stone of the Leys. Though studied by many scholars, no one has yet determined what this means. The most common theory is that this is the final resting place of the famous Lady Lyn of the House of Leys. A crazy bird-man, rumored to eat children and pets, is said to inhabit the area between here and Feather Shoals. 

Crazy Bird-Man: CR 3; SZ M Aberration; HD 6d8+6; hp 37; Init +5 (Dex, Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft., fly 60 ft. (good); AC 18 (+5 Dex, +3 natural), touch 15, flat-footed 13; BAB +5; Grap +5; Atk/Full Atk +5 melee (1d8, shortspear, crit x3) or +10 ranged (1d8, shortspear, crit x3, range 20 ft.); Face/Reach 5 ft./5 ft.; SQ darkvision (90 ft.), low-light vision; AL CG; SV Fort +3, Ref +7, Will +7; Str 10, Dex 21, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 10.

Skills: Hide +11, Listen +8, Move Silently +8 (+16\*), Spot +8, Wilderness Lore +6. Feats: Alert-ness, Flyby Attack, Weapon Focus (shortspear). \* Bird-man receives a +8 racial bonus to its Move Silently skill while flying.

Note (yellow):
4708 Pitts, Lake (Calm Aquatic): This lake is believed to be of artificial construction, accidentally made by a geomancer who was trying to bury an invading army. An aquatic species of tanglenut is found in the lake, bearing strange nuts that float to the surface and explode with a “pop” to spread their seeds. Piranha and barracuda roam the waters of Lake Pitts but, of course, cannot harm the Stone Man who lives at the bottom of the lake. Black panthers roam the shores and environs.

Note (yellow):
2620 Shilly Shallows (Calm Aquatic, Busy): Technically of the mouth of the Kendhras River, the shallows have a long history. It is there where Pegohas wooed the fair Maselle and where the ancient King Ahabdosset defeated the demon Grotubyl and his orc legions. Giant centipedes infest the forest. Skeletons haunt the Shilly Shadows as well as an occasional ghoul or ghost.

Note (yellow):
3018 Sprinkle Creek (Calm Aquatic): Breaking from the Leander at Dell, Sprinkle Creek is a great source of trout and smaller fish. Many of the normal animals of the Elsenwood prefer this small stream.

Note (yellow):
1633 Dankbark Forest (Dense Forest): Dankbark Forest — said to be the oldest in all the Wilderlands — is known for its large population of treants and its monstrous spiders, many measuring over five feet across, that sometimes drop silver sticky webs over a whole caravan. The lairs are rumored to contain fortunes of silver objects, and many magical wands or staves. Other forest creatures are said to be quite friendly and unafraid of sentient races. A common smell that pervades throughout Dankbark is the reek moss on the northern side of trees; the moss is poisonous to touch (Contact DC 15, initial damage 2d4 Dex, secondary damage 1 permanent point of Dex). Recently, 12 werebears have reportedly moved in the forest east of the Leander River. The shed skin of the rare bortagurm snake of this forest will heal all sicknesses not magical or wound-induced. A hidden door in one tree leads to a dungeon. Encounters: enormous monstrous spiders, lycanthropes (werebears), treants

Note (yellow):
1727 Crown Knoll (Rugged Hills, EL 12): It is said that four crowns enriched with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emer-alds, pearls and other valuable gems lie beneath Crown Knoll. One legend not often spoken, says that the four kings buried here were slain by Viridians centuries ago and they will remain restless until they can affect revenge. Rumor also hints they keep in military practice and await the Keeper of the Gardens to set them free.

Note (yellow):
1329 Celedorinlin (Medium Forest): The ground grows firmer and the trees less dense in the eastern half of the Slithytove Woods. The area is named for the ruins of an ancient city that once thrived here. Encounters: bears, dire wolves

Note (yellow):
0711 Dacil Vonidar, Hills of (Rugged Hills): In this small range of hills on the east side of the Pinnacle Mountains, an ancient script written on a stone bears a strange riddle. Reading the inscription requires a Decipher Script check (DC 35), which if successful reads: “Dacil Vonidar is a place that is a place that isn't. Its walls are black, its surface white; its walks are paved yet never trod; the voices even, the aura odd; most by day and known by night; its echoes sound a distant knell; its treasure vast, is hid from greed —its finder dies to birth the seed; and far is near but near is hell. Dacil Vonidar is a dream that was, a hope that is, and an impossibility that will be.”

Note (yellow):
1726 Chekulon River (Calm Aquatic): This broad river flows down from the Glass Mountains and through the Missing Memory Marshes before joining the River Leander at Rock Haven.

Note (yellow):
4316 Billow Torrent (Rough Aquatic): A rushing stretch of the Hyando, the torrent is a favorite spot for bears of the Thistle-down to catch salmon. Encounters: bears, deer, foxes

Note (yellow):
4703 Aves Sanctuary (Calm Aquatic): The birdkeepers of Kevala come here to capture birds or collect eggs with the intention of raising and domesticating the chicks. Some birds are best left alone; the tall wading blue-tailed stabbit attacks anything that moves toward it; the little brown warner flits from tree to tree warning all of new or unusual activities; the striped gungvird warbler is a sign of bad luck; and the white-headed hawk tells secrets of buried treasure. The watercourse is named for the ancient sage Aves the Plagued, who is said to have been tormented by 12 imps sent against him by the rulers of the Demon Empire. A fairy king took pity on Aves and enchanted the region to serve as a refuge, where the old sage dwelled, protecting a mystical fairy ring hidden in a glade near his home. No one today knows whether this legend is true or not, but some stories claim that Aves still lives and that his home is a place of magic and wonderment.

Note (yellow):
Viridistan exerts influence all across the region – though certainly more in some places than others. The lands around the great city are divided into imperial provinces, each with its own padishah and administrative staff. Sev-eral of these provinces — Shardis and Gommorath, for example — extend off the map-edge. This is merely a Viridian conceit — in reality their influence remains limited to the area portrayed on the map.

Effernath

Padishah: Shah Satyrbis

Capital: Caer Cadwen

Boundaries: Shorn River on the south; Shelter Haven on the west; Dyndale on the north; Sandysack River on the east.

Notes: Relatively small, this province is nevertheless important since it entirely encompasses the trouble-some Elsenwood and the uncooperative wood and wild elves who live there. Outside the woods, the province also includes unpleasant bogland as well as the rich farmlands surrounding the city of Viridistan itself.

Gommorath

Padishah: Shah Drong Dirkah

Capital: Grimlon

Boundaries: Plateau of Bendigroth on the north, Lake Pitts, Ladd River on the west, Nho river on the south, and east.

Notes: Extending from the extreme north to the southernmost portions of Viridistan's territory, Gommorath encompasses a wide range of climates, and also borders on lands claimed by Viridistan's rival, the City State of the Invincible Overlord.

Lyoophiath

Padishah: Shah Abdu Inslar

Capital: Tarnol Port

Boundaries: Sully on the south; Upper Stickthorne and Sandysack rivers on the west; Ladd River and Lake Pitts on the east; and Gheulost Island.

Notes: Including the rich central plains of Viridistan's realm, this province is known for its rich hunting grounds and forests harvested for timber that is used throughout the empire.

Shardis

Padishah: Shah Pahrrib Fu

Capital: Millo Fortress

Boundaries: Chekulon and Shorn Rivers and south.

Notes: After the neighboring province of Smyrsis, Shardis is the wildest and least-settled of the im-perial provinces. Owing to the traffic of pilgrims to and from the Holy Cities to the south, it is also one of the most important, for this traffic gener-ates considerable revenue for the emperor's coffers. Millo Fortress has grown to an important way-station on for pilgrims, and Shah Pahrrib has grown rich because of them.

Smyrsis

Padishah: Shah Kijdawr Aenekosii

Capital: Tell Qa

Boundaries: Chekulon River on the south; Pinnacle Mountains on the west; Bone Hollow, Glint Valley and Shelter Haven on the east.

Notes: The wildest and most difficult-to-govern prov-ince, Smyrsis includes extensive swaths of Elphand territories as well as many wilderness regions containing many tribes of savage humanoids. The Pinnacle Moun-tain mines with their rich silver deposits are in this province, as is the mysterious Valley of the Dead Queens.

Thygamus

Padishah: Shah Dyshim Leayh

Capital: Tak Shire

Boundaries: Dyndale on the south; Oonsla on the west; Upper Stickthorne River on the east.

Notes: Somewhat impoverished and filled with bar-ren hills and livestock farms, Thygamus remains one of the least desirable of the imperial provinces.

Note (yellow):
3501 Adder Copse (Dense Forest, EL 17): This deadly forest is crawling with poisonous serpents under the control of the evil Prince Dahmen

Note (green):

Note (blue):
0109 Dire Skunks (EL 4): A mated pair of dire skunks (see below) have found a home in this area. They are generally docile and usually ignore most people in the area.

Dire Skunk: CR2; SZ M Animal (6 ft. long); HD 3d8+3; hp 16; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 40 ft.; AC 15 (+3 Dex, +2 natural), touch 13, flat-footed 13; BAB +2; Grap +4; Atk claw +4 (1d4+2); Full Atk 2 claws +3 melee (1d4+2), bite -1 melee (1d6+1); Face/Reach 5 ft./5 ft.; SA breath weapon (repulsion gas-creatures within the cone \[5' high, 5' wide and 15' long\] must succeed at a Will save \[DC 14\] or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dire skunk for 1d6 rounds); disease (Fort DC 12, filth fever), effect cha-risma (anyone in a cone of repulsion gas has a –4 synergy bonus to reaction checks for 1 week); SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +4, Ref +4, Will +4; Str 14, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 2; Skills: Listen +6, Spot +6; Feats: Weapon Finesse (bite).

Note (green):

Note (blue):
0126 Lion's Den (EL 9): A pride of 8 lions (CR 3, hp 32 each) makes its lair in the area. They generally avoid contact with humanoid races, but attack if their lair is threatened.

Note (green):
0131 The King's Tomb: The plundered tomb of an ancient king is found in a small, barren cave connected to the surface by a worn set of green marble stairs. Anyone traversing the stairs is confronted by an illusory image of the long-dead king who pleads for all to leave him rest in peace. Any items of value, whether originally left in the cave or buried with the monarch, are long gone. Some say this is the tomb of the first True Viridian king, though no images of Armadad Bog appear in this tomb.

Note (green):
0220 Grotto of Grime (EL 26): Slaekt, a great wyrm gold dragon (CR 26; HD 41d12+451; hp 900; AL LG; Str 47, Dex 10, Con 33, Int 32, Wis 33, Cha 32) holds sway over the territory here. In this rugged and hardy countryside, halfway between Pamak Illip and Glass Mountain is located Slaekt's grotto. Littering the entrance of this den are piles of bones, a warning to those with designs upon the inhabitant or his horde. The dark, rocky, sandy depths of his abode are covered with gems, coins, jewelry, and other valuables – all of which are filth encrusted. Splattered with iridescent flecks of blue, this golden dragon is dazzling to look at, enough so that any who look directly into his whirling colorful eyes are mesmer-ized unless the make a successful Will save (DC 41). Being the oldest, most intelligent, and most feared dragon in the world, only a few are capable of talking with him (though lawful good, he still eats intruders). Slaekt enjoys feasting on moun-tain goats and desert creatures, however an occasional raid for cattle or terrorizing of a nearby village to the west is not unheard of. While somewhat retiring and antisocial, Slaekt is easily aroused. If one cares to live, they are warned not to touch his treasure. Slaekt's keen mind is the caretaker of a great deal of ancient lore, including knowledge of many long-forgotten spells, important history, magic lore, and many of old powerful relics in the empire. However, the locations of such relics is not known by this grand creature. Preferring to be alone, Slaekt does not welcome visitors unless properly approached with large gifts — preferring gems, coins, and magic items. Those who are allowed entrance find Slaekt to be quite the conversationalist, seeking information about the goings-on of the world outside. His accumulated treasure contains dozens of magic items and literally millions of gp in gems, coins and art (left up to the judge). Hidden at the bottom of a jewel-filled golden urn buried in one of the many piles of gems and magical items is the amulet Tokborndeth.

Tokborndeth is a golden amulet set with a piece of polished onyx. Once per day the amulet's wearer can add up to eight negative levels to any one creature with a successful ranged touch attack as per the spell energy drain cast by a 18th level sorcerer. These energy levels are transferred to the wearer, bestowing five temporary hit points per level drained, and last for 24 hours at the end of which time they return to the original owner.
Caster Level: 18th. Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, energy drain. Market Value: 64,800 gp. Weight: 1/2 pound.

Note (blue):
0222 Chimera Lair (EL 9): A mated pair of chimera (CR 7, hp 76) makes its home here. Both are equally territorial and attack most living creatures entering their area. They protect a horde of 1,000 gp, a potion of cure moderate wounds, and a potion of blur.

Authority Figure: Slintigil, male gnome CE Ftr5. Important Characters: Agrumar, male gnome NE Wiz5 (owns the feed, seed and dry goods store); Aleritram, male gnome N Exp5 (master glass blower); Thilakin, male gnome LN Clr4 (Sashu, god of Justice).

With the support of Agrumar, Slintigil controls this small hamlet. Aleritram owns the glass blowing foundry. As long as business stays good, he doesn't care what Slintigil does.

Note (green):
0301 NEAPOLIS (Hamlet): Conventional; AL CE; TL 3; 100 gp limit; Assets 988 gp; Population 316 (Able bodied 79); Mixed (human \[many Elphan\]); Resources: bronze.

Impor-tant Characters: Ruk, male Elphan NE War4 (tribal chieftain); Bidash, male human CE Clr4 (shaman of Mawdorn god of Shadows); Vruk, male Altanian LE Exp4 (owns the smelting operations).

Huh dominates this tribe of cavemen through Ruk and Bidash. They mine copper and tin, which is then smelted into bronze. The bronze is then shipped from Neapolis to Viridistan

Note (blue):
0303 Giant Beetles (EL 5): A small pack of 3 giant bombardier beetles (CR 2; hp 13 each) have made a home here. They are nocturnal hunters, and come out as the sun is disappearing over the horizon

Note (red):
0313 Flying Castle: A small metallic castle made of aluminum lies here, completely covered with cinders and ashes. It used to float in the sky but its mechanism failed and it came crashing to earth, although it is only slightly damaged because it was flying quite low at the time. The skeletal remains of a human leg are caught in the doorway. Inside the castle are a variety of broken metal tools.

Note (green):
0314 ANME CAPHRI (Hamlet): Magical; AL LG; TL 7; 100 gp limit; Assets 438 gp; Population 140 (Able bodied 35); Mixed (human 88% \[mixed, many Common Viridian and Tharbrian\], elf 8%, gnome 4%); Resources: sheep.

The residents of Anme Caphri are sheepherders. There is a small shrine to Athena here that is attended by Paennon. The village is too small to support a cleric so Paennon spends most of his time in the fields helping tend the sheep. It is said by the villagers that there is a great treasure to be found in the Valley of the Dead Queens.

Note (blue):
0321 The Fire Hydra Lair (EL 7): A rocky outcrop-ping provides shelter to a six-headed pyrohydra (CR 7; hp 63), with a treasure of 600 gp and a raise dead scroll.

He also has certain magical items that protect him as well as the blessing of the shah of Smyrisis. Beoc Prooze captures strong cavemen and sells them in Targnol Port as slaves. He is absolutely ruthless. It is said that Morwen gathers her exotic aphrodisiacs in the hills about but no one knows where. Bats flutter about her wherever she goes at night.

Note (green):
0421 Orc Diamond Mines of Glass Mountain (EL 1 to 15): Orcs (CR 1/2; hp 4) are not especially good miners, but they are greedy. The orcs trade uncut diamonds with thieves, brigands and shifty-eyed traders, directed in their mining activities by Fagslak (CR 14; hp 136; AL CE; Str 15, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 17; battle axe, throwing axes). Gakbog (CR 10; hp 85; AL CE; Str 14, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 16, Wis 16, Cha 16; longsword) and Unstigib (CR 9; hp 84; AL CE; Str 15, Dex 17, Con 17, Int 16, Wis 16, Cha 16; warhammer) oversee the guards of both entrances to the mountain. The orcs protect a curious statue of an unknown being or beast carved from an obsidian peak on the mountain. Lights play about the statue on dark nights, after which the statue has been known to change shape. One underground tunnel leads to a large crystal room filled with treasures, booty and diamonds that the orcs enjoy counting (even though many orcs cannot count past ten). They have few magical items, but lots of wealth. There is a legend about a princess who sat on top of Glass Mountain a long time ago waiting for a prince to claim her as per instructions of a king. A prince did come, so the story goes, riding on a horse made of diamonds. But the princess became greedy and struck the horse to shatter it, but the diamonds sank into the Glass Mountain top as though it were mud. The prince turned into a hideous orc and ate the princess, and her bleached bones still lie in the morning sun at the top of Glass Mountain, untouched by the centuries.

Note (blue):
0422 The Crystal Monster: In the small mountain range to the south of Crystal Lake there lives the one and only Crystal Monster (see sidebar). This lizard-like creature with an insect-like head and multi-faceted eyes is about the size of an alligator. Its gem-encrusted hide has many good magical powers and the six tentacles on its head that can heal all manner of diseases. It is generally harmless unless it feels threatened or an evil individual comes near; then it will excrete a poisonous gas. It lives in mountain clefts and is hard to spot by day, but can be found at night due to its glow.

0527 The Lady of the Lake: This section of Lake Saffrin is known for being the abode of the Lady of the Lake (female human ghost, Sor20; CR 22; hp 122; AL LN). Not much is known about this ancient one except that she lives under the water for decades without ever showing herself, sometimes rising out of the water to correct wrongs or grant gifts to those who have done good. No one has ever actually seen the lady, and her view of right and wrong is sometimes bizarre. Her “corrections” can be ruthless and overly enthusiastic. Once she turned the population of an entire village into beasts. Forty skeletons hang on poles in the portion of the Slithytove Woods between Lake Saffrin and Saimon, the work of the tiny and evil fairy, named Embe (female grig Sor6/Rog5; CR 12; hp 46; AL CE). The forest between Lake Saffrin and Slithytove is full of tangle vines and giant chigger bloodsuckers of up to 2 inches in size.

In a hilly valley sur-rounded by ranges of the Starrcrag Mountains lies a large tower known as Obsidian Citadel, ruled by a particularly ferocious storm giant. He rules several hundred personal servants and an army of slaves made up of orcs, zombies and cauldron-born — enhanced zombies that are said to be created in a powerful artifact created by an evil god of the dead. He prefers solitude and slays all visitors; his servants raise crops and mine electrum. His minions keeps the orcs from coming north and the dwarves from coming south, keeping them apart. The slick black citadel tower and other obsidian bulwarks have a long checkered history lost in antiquity. The interiors are stark but many riches are hidden throughout the corridors, rooms, chambers, tunnels, stairs, caverns and pits. A prophecy of long past says an owl man of lapis lazuli with crest of porphyry will free the tower of its evil curses and start it on a long age of standing for good

Skills: Climb +16, Hide +11, Move Silently +5, Spot +3. Feats: Multiattack, Multidexterity, Weapon Finesse (claw).

Psionics (Sp): Su-monsters have a latent psionic ability that enables them to deliver some form of psionic attack if psionic energy is being used within 120 feet of them. Su-monsters can, once per round, manifest one of three psionic attack modes: ego whip, mind thrust, or psychic crush.

0817 Starrcrag Mountain Gold dwarf Mines (EL Variable): A red bearded clan of mountain dwarves lives in this portion of the Starrcrags and tolerates no visitors except traders. There are over 300 ordinary dwarves (CR 1/2; hp 4 each), aided by 50 warriors (War1; CR 1/2; hp 5 each), 30 mountain guards (Ftr1-3), 10 officers (Ftr5) and 5 stone wizards (Wiz5). Wrinkled and tough as old tree roots, these large-headed, barrel-chested fighters are tenacious miners. They are the last remaining expert goldsmiths that can capture wondrous magical powers into golden jewelry. There is a warning monument deep in the mountain, erected to remind the dwarf descendants of Bruskin, who lost his artistic pride and became miserly. His hoarding of wealth attracted dragons, brigands, and orcs, keeping him preoccupied with wars and skirmishes for thirty wasted years when his cohorts got little mining done. He eventually died by the sword and his riches were plundered. The powerful Cat's Eye Ring, finely wrought long ago, is lost somewhere in the mines. On the wall of the central living quarters there hangs the magical sword named Fence that only defends and never strikes, a fine coach that folds into a pocket-size money bag and the lost Mermaid Trident. By the hearth is a horn of ivory bounded with diamonds (worth 8,000 gp), and several spears of a strange balance (halfspears, +1 to ranged attack, -1 to melee attack)

CAT'S EYE RING
This artifact, which has a long list of owners, provides its wearer with a +8 enhancement to Dex-terity, low-light vision and the ability to see all invisible creatures and objects within 60 ft. The Cat's Eye Ring further bestows a +10 circumstance bonus to Listen and Spot checks, as well as an additional +5 circumstance bonus to Balance and Tumble checks. Finally, the ring grants the wearer the Alterness feat if she does not already have it. Anyone wearing this band for even a single night has her eyes change in appearance to those of a cat. Continual wear for a month's time results in the wearer's digits growing slender and her nails claw-like. These two effects combine to decrease the wearer's Charisma by 2 if the ring is worn for longer than one month. The catlike features disappear after the wearer has left the ring off for a year and a day. Caster Level: 16th; Weight: -.

FENCE
A bejeweled, finely-wrought mithral shortsword, Fence exists only to protect its wielder. Any attempt to use Fence to cut a person or object fails, however while in use it provides a +4 bonus that stacks with all others to the wielder's AC. Fence also has a dancing enhancement that allows the user to let it go in combat and fight with a different weapon while Fence defends him. Caster Level: 15th; Weight: 3 lb

MERMAID TRIDENT
This glistening polearm has a +3 enhancement bonus. Upon command, once per day, the wielder can transform himself into a merfolk or human for as long as desired. Thus this armament is useful to either land or sea dweller. Caster Level: 11th; Weight: 5 lbs.

They are often called the Elphan Riders. Amir Nailah Musa has been assigned a cavalry section and is responsible for protection of the area

They live in the hollowed-out trunks of large baksome trees, and sometimes protect wayfarers from the giant spiders of the Dankbark Forest. King Bulerindel pushes for more friendly relations with men beyond selling them wine and ropes, but has not been very successful. They often barter creatures caught in their webs.

Smyrsis is probably the most difficult province to control and Shah Kijdawr Aenekosii is only in the position because of his great competence. An enemy to all that is evil, the shah keeps troublemakers in their own areas. He continually opposes most of the rest of the council, including the emperor. The shah has no grandee at the moment since he banished his most recent one. Tell Qa is a very strong, secure fortress on a cliff overlooking the River Flee. It has two outer curtains and baileys, many round towers and bastions, two donjons and a great earthen wall outside the moat. Four mangonels guard the four quarters. There are several secret passages, some known only to the shah and others of his close retainers. There is reputed to be a room of emeralds in Tell Qa but nobody has ever seen it. Many have visited the Room of Passionate Pleasures which the shah hates and has threatened to close. His troops protest this unpopular action and ignore crimes there. The forests along the River Flee abound in kobolds. Travelers move in large groups to avoid being imprisoned in one of the many riverbank caves were the kobolds dwell. A powerful monster called the “Gormhorn” roams the Tell Qa environs. It high metabolism forces it to eat almost constantly. Its head is in the shape of a ragged horn outlined with four burning eyes on each side. Several long protruding tentacles come from the end of the horn to suck blood.

Nameless, at least to outsiders, they sneak through rubble and underground passages full of radioactive waste. Hideously deformed, these “Eagols” have developed their powers of telepathy to communicate with each other over long distances. Their skin is poisonous to touch and they are unpredictable. The once great source of power that con-trolled the wonders of the Aouatad Temple, long thought lost, is still intact and protected by the Eagols. This portable “weapon” is based on telekinetic principles and can cause great good or great destruction. Radioactive diamonds that cause wasting disease litter the lower regions.

Millo Fortress is an ancient stronghold designed as the first line of defense against unruly desert people and berserkers. It is now a way station on the road to the Holy Cities. The fortress' moat is river fed and its sheer curtain walls are formidable indeed. Surrounded by dangerous forest, travelers are most relieved to reach the inner courts of Millo Fortress. Werebears (CR 5; hp 62 each) have recently been terrifying the fortress environs and an expedition to discover their lair has been delayed for lack of volunteers. Shah Fu and Grandees Pipt and Gubbin run the outpost by the book. Food and supplies are care fully measured. Of course, they live in comfort while most of the help live spartan lives. The one pleasure in most of their lives as well as the travelers' is the one large inn, The Sandy Sword. Friends and travelers exchange gossip and sing rowdy songs.

The hill giants of Brotbuckle Clan are a warty, blubbery and shy sort, preferring not to interfere with humans. However, if they can get away with something, they will blunder on, doing it openly. They fight ferociously but prefer not to. An occasional hill giant will develop a taste for human but are usually thrown out by the giants themselves for causing too much trouble. Spaen Brotbuckle, leader of the Clan, got his position accidentally and is now held in awe by his fellow giants. The Yakin Ley hill giants long feared a creature called the Moaning One of the Hundred Hands who dwelt in Rock Hollow. Hecatoncheires (the thing's real name) claimed to control the weather and threatened vile storms or worse if proper offerings were not given. One day, the Moaning One came demanding a collection of powerful magical items called “The Magical Three” as a sacrifice. Unable to obtain the items, the giants were thrown into a panic. Spaen, being even denser than most Giants, thought the Moan said “The Magical Tree” and so he risked the wrath of the Wood elves (actually, he was too scared to think about it) and ripped up the Holy Tree of the Magical Branches in Elsenwood, carried it all the way back to Yakin Ley and threw it into the Rock Hollow. The Moaning One was never heard from again and Spaen was a hero. The giants are, hefty but slightly rotund, have many warts and have a penchant for talking bones and singing harps. Jutum the Devourer and Aknekkle Seven Blow with their pet blink dogs guard the Yakin Ley grounds.

Somewhere at the far western edge of Elsenwood, beyond the western end of the Leafork Road, lies the abode of the fair folk called Shelter Haven. These fairies are very tall, about six or seven feet, and are seldom visible to most humans. Sometimes a faint glimmer of light or a sparkly glow can be seen out of the corner of one's eye but the fair folk avoid all not of their kind. Time moves at its own pace at Shelter Haven and humans caught there might find their families suddenly grown old when they return. The fairies never grow old, however. It is not wise to speak the name of a fairy here, for if one knows such a name, the fairy would come and punish the speaker out of fear of being magically controlled. It is better to call them “fair folk” than “fairies” for the same reason. The fair folk probably live under one or more of the several knolls in the area; but many fortune hunters attempting to disturb them have disappeared. Great wealth is said to be in abundance there — finely wrought drinking cups and vessels, fine harps and lyres, finger rings and bracelets, draperies and rugs in lush blues and reds, white horses bedecked in gold — but few have had the privilege of viewing it.

2621 CAER CADWEN (Small Town): Non-Standard; AL N; TL 9; 800 gp limit; Assets 76,600 gp; Population
3,064 (Able bodied 766); Mixed (human 100% \[mostly Common Viridian, some Tharbrian\]); Resources: market. Authority Figure: Shah Satyrbis Orkiss, female succubus (polymorphed to male Common Viridian form) CE Clr24 (Orcus). Important Characters: Grand Dagmaggus, male Common Viridian LE Ftr17.

Caer Cadwen is a castle of the older type with square or rectangular baileys, towers, barbican and keep but the buttresses and bastions on the outer curtain were added later and are round. It is said that the Hags of Marmon built the older parts of Caer Cadwen. The town that grew up around the walls was named for the castle. The Shah's solar is the most luxurious in the land, including, probably, the emperor's. In the Great Hall is a magic mirror that shows what is taking place in all the other province capitals of the empire. It is used mainly for amusement, but occasionally more. Shah Satyrbis rules with an iron hand and all dissidents and malcontents are ruthlessly hanged or tortured. Satyrbis gets along well with the emperor and shares the overseeing of some of the emperor's farmlands. Satyrbis performs just enough good deeds to confuse people into thinking he is good, kind and generous when instead “he” is in fact a succubus in the direct service of the demon prince Orcus. Dagmaggus — dark, tall and skinny with an ugly beak-nose — is just as cold as his boss. He carries out orders exactly but has a few designs of his own on his superior's job, as well as dastardly plans for amassing a private fortune. His ruby sword sweats blood whenever a person of higher level is present who has aggressive designs on its owner. The “blood,” however, is poison (DC 14; 1d4 Str/1d4 Str). Lost under a storeroom floor (DC 25 Search) is a small stone that radiates magic and is inscribed with very old runes (DC 20 read languages) that say I – to Flower. It is the first of seven legendary items, the Stones of Power

STONES OF POWER

There are seven of these enchanted stones, each inscribed with a number and a runic inscription (DC 20 read languages to decipher). They are called I – to Flower; II – to Cry; III – to Burn; IV – to Cower; V – to Dethrone; VI – to Spurn; and VII – to Save and Protect, to Heal and Learn. These items add two class levels to any LG or CG owner as long as all seven remain in her possession. In addition, if each of the instructions on the stones is followed in order (it is up to the judge to determine exactly what each instruc-tion entails), the stones give the bearer the permanent ability to use suggestion as a spell-like ability on all kings, nobles and rulers within 30 feet (DC 30 Will resists) as long as they remain in her possession. If lost, all effects are also lost and the instructions must be followed in order for the powers to be restored.

3107 Witch Lair (EL 42): Experts at shapechanging, all three witches (called the Marmon Hags) can take on any form, appearing most often appear as hags or beautiful maidens. The Marmon consider themselves outside moral alignments and are incredibly ancient. They are touchy about their privacy — they keep the swamp supplied with frogs that were once unwanted visitors. A long hut is their lair, a location where they do a lot of spinning. Strange occult objects, herbs, and containers line the walls. Several other huts contain magical items of great power (30 to 60 per hut), and virtually any non-artifact item can be found here. Intruders seldom leave like they came unless they have great power or have something of great magical value to trade. Chael (Wit20/Drd 20; hp 415; AL N; Str 28, Dex 23, Con 23, Int 24, Wis 26, Cha 10) is the leader of the three and is the most creative; Phyth (Wit20/Drd 15; CR 35; hp 350; AL N; Str 28, Dex 23, Con 18, Int 26, Wis 24, Cha 20) is the most unstable and prefers to molest or eat intruders; Gaedd (Wit20/Clr20 \[Rhiannon\]; CR 40; hp 460; AL N; Str 28, Dex 23, Con 24, Int 23, Wis 22, Cha 20) is a steadying influence and helps them keep a low profile. The Marmon do not know quite what to make of Mycretians. They would like to meet Mycr or a prophet of his and match talents. Judges could appropriately give the Marmon hags each a Divine Rank 0. They have no worshipers, but their power is so ancient as to be nearly god-like. Even the Green Emperor of Viridistan fears them, though he suspects they are the reason he is recently losing his spell knowledge and blames them for the disappearance of some of his magic items. The spies he has sent to investigate the hags have never returned. Despite his suspicions, the hags are not to blame. The Marmon are well aware of what has been happening to Hautulin Seheitt in Viridistan but don't care one way or the other; however, they are curious how so many objects of magic could have disappeared without their knowing where they went. The witches suspect Whitefire (an apothecary in Viridistan who is a male True Viridian CE Wiz30 and the lost son of the Green Emperor) since he has stolen some of the Emperor's items; they plan to investigate.

Further discussion of the Marmon Witches can be found in the classic Judges Guild product City State of the World Emperor.

Hefaelond Cleft is so well hidden and protected that very few know its exact location. Because of this, the elves have lived for centuries in their underground home through many political regimes and have always survived. Splendulin and Efrinodel, brother lords of the elves, rule all Elsenwood and their unknown number of kin and elfin subjects. Each has two sons, Lómithrawyn, Eärorion, Lómithrambor, and Celondir, who are very competitive and despise their cousins. The elves are amused at the wall the emperor has built, and they mistakenly think that he put it there to keep them out. But the emperor is really more worried about the Hags of Marmon than he is about elves. This may be a mistake on his part, however.

The City State of the World Emperor (CSWE), otherwise known as Viridistan, the City of Spices, the Immortal City, or simply “the City,” has been ruled for the past 150 years by Hautulin Seheitt, and his wife
Murielle Eidn, who are popularly believed to be the last of the True Viridians — a once haughty and powerful race. Sehitt, the “Green Emperor,” for that is what he is called, due to the cast of his skin (he has restored the rule of the True Viridians), is highly lawful and evil, and prone to extensive use of sorcery to maintain the Imperial Domain. Both claim to be descendants of the gods of the Uttermost War; living gods deserving of worship. Some claim they are descended from the wild men (ancient Tharbrians) and the mermaids of Trident Gulf. The True Viridians founded Viridistan 4332 years ago (in 101 BCCC), shortly after subjugating large areas held by the wild men.

The City State of the World Emperor has always been ruled with a strong hand by its “hereditary” monarch. The High Council, made up of one viceroy, two Suzerain, and six Padishah, meets twice a year in late spring and fall for official reporting, information sharing, and setting mutually beneficial policies to recommend to the Emperor. It has no vote in the final say. The City has had a stormy and checkered history centering around Viridian internal bickering and assassination plots to gain control of the throne. The “hereditary” monarchy has therefore seldom been passed on to son or daughter but due to treachery of one kind or another it has often been usurped by Viceroy, Suzerain and occasionally by a Padishah. The aristocratic True Viridian race was thus gradually destroyed from within until Seheitt and Eidn were rumored to be the last two of the race left, except possibly for their only son who disappeared 75 years ago and has not been seen since (he is in fact the current head of the priesthood of Natch Ur and plots for his father's throne). In truth there are far more True Viridians in existence, some in the far flung corners of the Wilderlands as well as many still in Viridistan, though most do not show their faces or use sorcery or other means to disguise themselves.

Since common men (Tharbrian descendants of the Wild Men and Common Viridians) had for some time been moving up in social class into gentry and nobility ranks to replace the diminishing Viridians, the Emperor has attempted to replace some of them with demons and has been successful in four cases. The demons must look like common men and women, however, because most Viridian citizens do not care for strange differences in their neighbors. For this reason the Emperor and Empress can no longer show their faces in public and orcs and goblins are not welcome in the City even though some Mer Shunnans and Natchai (followers of Armadad Bog and Natch Ur) are friendly with them.

All six provinces of Viridistan are ruled by mortal kings (or so the general populace thinks) called Padishah. These rulers swear their allegiance to the Green Emperor and the Immortal City when they are picked by the Emperor from the ranks of Grandhee and Archon outwardly at special tournaments but actually via political and religious intrigue.

All but two of the Viridian emperors of the Immortal City have been thoroughly evil: Reddisorn the Golden (ruled from 2089 - 2272 BCCC), Conqueror of the Great Wind and enemy of Kukalan, and Cneninadus the Mycretian (ruled from 4226 - 4283 BCCC). Cneninadus' reign approached the Golden Age of Reddisorn in its encouragement of the arts, education and civil rights but had not the peace and tranquility he sought. It was unheard of for any Viridian to become a follower of the god, Mycr. Indeed, most emperors had been Natchai, a religion with an alignment far removed from that of Mycr. The Mycretian distaste for human sacrifice, blood-thirsty greed and the powers of the Dark exacerbated the enmity between Cneninadus and the eleven other then-existing (publicly known) True Viridians and so his reign was marked by bloodshed and attempted assassinations. He was finally murdered by Hautulin Seheitt and eight demons in 4283 BCCC. It is said that the Green Emperor is substantially in the debt of several of the demons he summoned to aid him in the overthrow of Cneninadus. The Green Emperor has an elite group of six (divided into two teams of three) highly loyal and fanatical followers of Armadad Bog known as the Black Adders. They are highly trained experts in tracking, sabotage, assassination, and other highly paid dirty work. All six live in the City incognito in other professions, and are known by only the Emperor, Empress, and three others. The Black Adders are extremely intelligent, extremely resourceful, and extremely effective.

The Green Emperor, a Mer Shunnan, was a high priest of Armadad Bog at the time he took power. In doing so he greatly increased the importance of Armadad Bog, angered the followers of Natch Ur since Emperors are traditionally followers of that god, and restored the rule of the True Viridians to the throne of Viridistan, as many of the recent Emperors had not been of that race. In the Great Slaughter of Pain in 4284, Seheitt decimated the Mycretians and their sympathizers, even making two raids with Imperial troops into the caverns of the Holy Cities to kill two of their Prophets. He still maintains Imperial troops in and around the Holy Cities to this day, who occupy the area in an uneasy truce with the local populace. Upon completion of this bloodbath of terror, the Green Emperor was re-warded by Armadad Bog by being ordained as the only Mer Shunnan God-Priest, at which time Seheitt ascended to god-hood himself and was given Divine Rank, though still a mortal man. Armadad Bog took up residence deep under the palace in the natural bay inlet soon after Seheitt had built him a temple near the inner castle curtain.

In addition to the Mer Shunnan worshipers of Armadad Bog and the Natchai followers of Natch Ur (many of who secretly see the current weakness of the Emperor as a chance to regain the throne of Viridistan for a follower of their god), the city has major temples to Shang Ta the Sky God, Nephthys the Spider Goddess of Wealth, Seker, the Gnosophim of Thoth, Tama Hama the Goddess of Passion and the Health Seekers of Ugtargent. Many other minor shrines are present. Secret cults of Mycretians also can be found in the city. It is still technically illegal to be a Mycretian within the City walls, but within the last twenty years or so, the Green Emperor has not been pressing the hunt, nor charges, as often as before. He has seemed preoccupied. But since he does still occasionally lash out, it is not wise to broadcast the fact of one's being a follower of Mycr. Mycretians have increased rapidly in numbers in those few years, until now they number about ten percent of the City, and for the most part, are well received and liked by most of the City's inhabitants. Mycretians have had a direct hand in the increasing tensions that are now racking the Immortal City, especially in their rescuing and spiriting away humans in danger of being sacrificed. Greatly weakened during the past 150 years due to the Green Emperor's vicious antagonism, the Mycretians have only been able to step up their missionary activities within the last fifteen years. The percentage of high level Mycretians is higher now than it has been in the Immortal City for decades. Several gods have been angered, and the City and surrounding areas experienced a minor earthquake three months ago. Most of the damage has been repaired. Taxes have been doubled in the last five years in the City State of the World Emperor.

The bothersome Hill Giants of Yakin Ley have captured Ramarche and Ruppin Athuk by defeating three Equithrongs and four Vasthrongs of the Emperor's, and little has been done about it. While the Emperor has only appeared publicly in the last twenty-five years with his head and face covered by a silver cowl, he has not been seen at a public function for eighteen months. Rumor has it that the Emperor has been gradually losing his once incredible magical powers, and has become uncertain or even afraid. Other rumors claim he is getting senile. Still others claim that the many powerful demons he summoned to aid his overthrow are exacting their price. Some (including the Emperor himself) believe the Marmon Hags may be responsible. The truth is far darker — his long lost son, a wizard of great power and a follower of Natch Ur, plots against him.

The City State of the Invincible Overlord has sent tribute to Viridistan once a year since the Bloodless Battle of Barrad in 3788, when three of the Overlord's Vasthosts and the whole nearby village of Barrad dropped dead in their tracks due to unknown causes. Further evidence of the Emperor's strength came again in 4105 when what has become known as the Blackhart Crag Reminder, when a surprised Emperor archer Equithrong decimated an Overlord Vasthost with its special carbellium arrows. Constant minor testing of the Emperor's strength (at least until recently) had always been met with more than adequate arrows or sorcery. In the last ten years, however, more and more of these “testings” have succeeded, but with no logical pattern to which incidents go unchallenged. And now, the Emperor has again outrageously increased the tribute. Spies between the two cities are thick.

World Emperors for centuries have maintained a small wall between the Elsenwood Forest and the Emperor's farm lands, ostensibly to protect crops from marauding animals and to help keep an eye on the pesky wood elves' thieving habits. However, Seheitt, the Green Emperor, has just finished a seven year project to triple the height and strength of the wall, to add a moat, and to double the guard, all for reasons indecipherable to the general populace. Doubling the taxes has made many of the people very angry. Yet, for the Emperor to say nothing to defend his strange new policies is most out of character. It is “untidy,” a main reason why the Emperor has always despised the Invincible Overlord. For 150 years almost every situation had been dispatched quickly and orderly (even if somewhat ruthlessly) with the popular feeling always well in hand. So the inhabitants of the Immortal City are understandably uneasy and prone to listen seriously to rumors.

Recently, Queen Deleamakan of Sae Laamer approached Seheitt, asking him to intervene and obtain the Amulet of Khetren from the evil god Armadad Bog, who dwells beneath the Imperial Palace and who has enslaved her people. The Emperor is unwilling to grant her request, and has contemplated adding the mermaid queen to his harem, making Deleamakan quite eager to return home.

The Immortal City is known as the City of Spices for its many rare and unusual varieties as well as common varieties of spices which are grown here. The Mycretians and other City experts' knowledge on the care and marketing of herbs and spices is greatly in demand. The wine industry, too, is substantial as many extensive grape arbors are grown in frequent forest clearings and fields in various places along River Leander. Most of the province capitols produce their own ale and enough to trade besides. Targnol Port and the City State are both on the main trade route and both are major shipping ports. Trade by both land and sea is growing and the wide avenues of trade in Viridistan bustle with activity throughout the year's nine months of good weather.

In the last five years the Emperor has doubled the size of his military troops (again at the expense of the taxpayers) until now he commands the equivalent of about five Vasthosts. Two battles are under each Padishah in each of the six provinces; two battles that he keeps in the Sunwatch and Moontower villages, and one that is scattered about in smaller groups. Guards and patrols police the City State so there is not much reason to keep large numbers of militia in the area. There are two Equithrongs of archers in the City, mostly “in reserve.” Archers make up a larger than usual percentage of the Green Emperor's army. Carbelium, a very rare red metal, lightweight, but extremely hard, is mined on the well-protected Gheulost Island. This strange metal, it has been decreed, can only be used for the creation of the Green Emperor's special arrowheads and the Emperor's elite archers are armed with them.

A secret personage of great importance in the city is the shadowy figure named Whitefire (male True Viridian, CE Wiz30/Archmage 5), who runs an apothecary close to the palace wall. Whitefire never lets his features be clearly seen. Dressed in black heavily hooded robes, he slinks about the city only at night; his name “Whitefire” comes from the unearthly flames that often unconsciously grace his fingers. No one in the city, not even his father, Hautulin Seheitt, knows his true identity. Whitefire is the Archmage for all Natchai. Whitefire has met the god Natch Ur twice, a record for mortals. A tunnel leads from the apothecary basement under the wall and into the palace. Whitefire has his own plans for taking over his father's rule but although he has managed to steal eleven magical items from the palace, he cannot find where his father has hid (he thinks) all the other magical sources of power. The Marmon Hags suspect him and are watching him.

IMPERIAL PROVINCES

Viridistan exerts influence all across the region – though certainly more in some places than others. The lands around the great city are divided into imperial provinces, each with its own padishah and administrative staff. Several of these provinces — Shardis and Gommorath, for example — extend off the map-edge. This is merely a Viridian conceit — in reality their influence remains limited to the area portrayed on the map.

Effernath

Padishah: Shah Satyrbis

Capital: Caer Cadwen

Boundaries: Shorn River on the south; Shelter Haven on the west; Dyndale on the north; Sandysack River on the east.

Notes: Relatively small, this province is nevertheless important since it entirely encompasses the trouble-some Elsenwood and the uncooperative wood and wild elves who live there. Outside the woods, the province also includes unpleasant bogland as well as the rich farmlands surrounding the city of Viridistan itself.

Gommorath

Padishah: Shah Drong Dirkah

Capital: Grimlon

Boundaries: Plateau of Bendigroth on the north, Lake Pitts, Ladd River on the west, Nho river on the south, and east.

Notes: Extending from the extreme north to the southernmost portions of Viridistan's territory, Gommorath encompasses a wide range of climates, and also borders on lands claimed by Viridistan's rival, the City State of the Invincible Overlord.

Lyoophiath

Padishah: Shah Abdu Inslar

Capital: Tarnol Port

Boundaries: Sully on the south; Upper Stickthorne and Sandysack rivers on the west; Ladd River and Lake Pitts on the east; and Gheulost Island.

Notes: Including the rich central plains of Viridistan's realm, this province is known for its rich hunting grounds and forests harvested for timber that is used throughout the empire.

Shardis

Padishah: Shah Pahrrib Fu

Capital: Millo Fortress

Boundaries: Chekulon and Shorn Rivers and south.

Notes: After the neighboring province of Smyrsis, Shardis is the wildest and least-settled of the imperial provinces. Owing to the traffic of pilgrims to and from the Holy Cities to the south, it is also one of the most important, for this traffic generates considerable revenue for the emperor's coffers. Millo Fortress has grown to an important way-station on for pilgrims, and Shah Pahrrib has grown rich because of them.

Smyrsis

Padishah: Shah Kijdawr Aenekosii

Capital: Tell Qa

Boundaries: Chekulon River on the south; Pinnacle Mountains on the west; Bone Hollow, Glint Valley and Shelter Haven on the east.

Notes: The wildest and most difficult-to-govern province, Smyrsis includes extensive swaths of Elphand territories as well as many wilderness regions containing many tribes of savage humanoids. The Pinnacle Mountain mines with their rich silver deposits are in this province, as is the mysterious Valley of the Dead Queens.

Thygamus

Padishah: Shah Dyshim Leayh

Capital: Tak Shire

Boundaries: Dyndale on the south; Oonsla on the west; Upper Stickthorne River on the east.

Notes: Somewhat impoverished and filled with bar-ren hills and livestock farms, Thygamus remains one of the least desirable of the imperial provinces.

Recre and Braddol are major suppliers of grain to Viridistan. All grain is shipped through Braddol, however, so they set the prices. Gamor the Boor is not only the largest farmer, but he also owns the Five Shield Inn. His wife and five sons manage it while he is at the farm. Many travelers stop here on their way to the Holy Cities and Wortess.

Braddol has two main industries, farming and clam fishing. Of late, they are having problems buying fishing boats from Wortess at a reasonable price so they are considering building their own. The problem is getting a good source of wood as Elsenwood is out of bounds due to the elves.

Located between trolls and quarrelsome pigherders, Takshire is nestled in barren hills around Geyser Spring, the source of the Upper Stickthorn. Takshire is more of a village than a fortress since the two curtain walls surround only small buildings — there is no keep or castle. The shah lives simply in the neighborhood of his advisors and all have irrigated gardens. Known familiarly by all as “Squat”, the shah is quite obese, short, and friendly but not jolly. He is fair, efficient and competent but has a weakness for fine women. He is very good with lightning bolts and setting up big magical defense screens.

The elves know his ways and don't like him, but he does keep the wall guards from wandering too far. Besides eating an occasional guard, Sliant is known to set fires to attract the unwary, then spitting poison at his prey. Sliant's poison is not only an immobilizer but also hallucinogenic, which makes it extremely valuable to certain religions and elements of society.

Note (blue):

3808 Tanngrisner (EL 15): Nestled away in a difficult-to-find valley among the rugged hills east of the Quessea River source there lives a short, stocky, grizzled old monk with salt and pepper hair and full beard named Tanngrisner (male human Drd12/Mnk8; CR 20; hp 97; Str 12, Dex 18, Con 15, Int 14, Wis 17, Cha 14). His enterprise is large and he has many monks working for him making special blends of teas from roots, stems, bark, leaves, flowers and berries of shrubs, trees and herbs of common and exotic varieties. The monks (all of whom are multi-classed druid/monks) are all short like their leader, wear brown-cowled robes and seldom speak. The sashes around their waists are interwoven hemp, gold and sweet smelling spices. Monsters seem to shy away from this strange company and evil creatures lose morale when the monks are near. Persistent problem visitors find themselves awaking from a drug-induced sleep miles away and confused. Animals keep the monks informed about approaching visitors; harmony with nature is the rule here. The tea is traded in tins: common tea, 8 sp per tin; the middle blends range from 1 gp to 3 gp; expensive teas, 4 gp to 10 gp; exotic teas, 10 gp and up. Tanngrisner is very intelligent, friendly, hospitable (a one night stay is all that is allowed, however) and unlike the other monks, a good conversationalist. He has a magical gaze weapon. If he wants to, he can “turn his eyes on” and use them as the powerful weapons they are (cause confusion and fear). Mycretian herbalists and peers are welcome visitors and may stay longer periods of time.

During the day, they sleep underground. These five are equally at home in the forest, rocky hills or riverbanks. Two gray-clad gnomes (CR 3; hp 24) cook for the trolls and manufacture great treasures from the loot the trolls capture. So far the trolls have 4,000 sp and a ring of regeneration (which the trolls have no use for). The gnomes have made a number of beautiful art objects — brooches, rings, statues and other pieces of jewelry with a total value of 1,400 gp (specific value by piece is up to the judge).

Note (green):
3815 Koses' Lair: This frightening creature is the one great danger in the Thistledown Forest. Koses is an old creature with no arms, three heads of simian-looking monsters, the body of a gorilla and four human legs and feet. Its main diet is leaves and shoots but it cannot digest them without entrails of mammals. Animals, humans, orcs, and all other humanoids are potential prey, so it is fortunate that Koses seldom travels far from his lair. Its bed is made of gems and bones. The lair is easy to locate due to the stench. A search for at least eight hours is required to locate the following gemstones: 1 fire opal (2,500 gp), 1 emerald (1,800 gp), 3 pink pearls (240 gp each), 14 smoky quartz (35 pg each), 5 onyx (30 gp each), 3 moss agates (15 gp each), 35 irregular fresh water pearls (8 gp each).

Sometimes they seem to bob up and down on the waves. Once on the islands, explorers find them as solid as any other. Tric and Trac are uninhabited since they are nothing but sand and rocks, but the tales spun among sailors keep men away as well, and too many ships have disappeared in the area. Several local legends surround these harmless islands including:

• The sole survivor of a shipwreck raved on and on about beautiful female voices and enticing songs com-ing from near the islands

• Many maps of chests of gold and jewels and treasure galore have turned up every now and then but when digging was tried, the holes always filled up with water as fast as they were dug, as if the sea were protecting the treasure.

• Green, many-tentacled sea monsters have been sighted in the area seemingly taking directions from mer-maids.

• Water spouts, under the guidance of some great god, protect the area from curious eyes.

• The island of Tric is named for an old stone giant who lives there, accompanied by his pet wolf, Licker. Tric enjoys helping stranded mariners and others in need. His brother Trac lives on the other island, and enjoys tormenting and killing any that venture nearby. His spiked pit traps are found throughout the island.

Targnol Port is a large town of disreputable character and unseemly habits. Most of the inhabitants are poor fishermen, but in the nobles' area large stone houses are well decorated and fortified. Shah Abdu Inslar is a very strong fighter with a sly streak. He enjoys warring about the countryside. He carries a hollow mace filled with poison and a flail. A black temple of black polished marble as smooth as glass graces the port center. It has a grand hall hung with silken tapestries, discreet alcoves with sofas covered with the softest furs of sapamas, alpacas, rabbits and chinchillas. Verandas, porches, fountains surrounded by flower gardens and shrubs all grace the central point at which stands a solid gold chimera. Tears shed in the Garden of Tears have been known to change to diamonds. A black enchantress lies in state in the viewing room and great reward is promised to any who break the enchantment (of course, this may not be wise) that holds her in deep sleep.

4308 Nathai Obelisk of Feigh: This amber obelisk stands 10 meters tall and is covered with glyphs in muted colors. It stands upon a round dais of blue white marble 20 meters in diameter. It is a sacred gathering place for fairies and it is said that the prince of fairies worships here every new moon of the Handmaiden. Animals and local peasants never venture near the obelisk as it is guarded by the spirit of Nathai Arphonel, a legendary fairy queen killed by Loki and restored by her Handmaiden goddess. The fairies have been known to take terrible toll upon those who tarry near this grove. Farmers say that a halfling wearing a ring of invisibility managed to mount the dais on the south side and examined the obelisk at noon. He touched yellow, blue and red glyphs and was transported hundreds of leagues to the south in an eye blink.

4630 NHO (Village): Magical; AL N, TL 7; 200 gp limit; Assets 7,520 gp; Population 1,391 (Able bodied 402); Mixed (human 90% \[mostly Common Viridian and Tharbrian, some Altanian\], dwarf 4%, gnome 3%, goblin 3%); Re-sources: fish, artifacts (non-magical). Authority Figure: Melit Shazepan, male human N Ftr7 (sheriff); Shizzan Fillar, female gnome LN Clr7 (mayor). Important Characters: Ewitik Earthmaster, male dwarf N Exp5 (expedition lead); Graham the Incessant, male Common Viridian LE Wiz5 (expedition-ary sage, deputy mayor); Dwilla Lodebottom, female Common Viridian CG Ftr4 (innkeeper); Kali Medpar IV, male Tharbrian NG Ari2/Com1 (fisherman leader); Dexxel Modlet, male goblin NE Ftr2 (slave leader).

Due to the Harkarim Ruins to the South East, Nho has increased in size to support the influx of explorers and investigators. The original town council fell by the wayside, facilitating the takeover of control by a self-appointing council of wizards bent on locating any and all secrets and devices of power still buried nearby. The goblin slaves are kept in line by Dexxel, giving little reason for the dwarven and gnomish population to object too strongly to their reasonable treatment; an odd cultural twist certainly noteworthy to those coming here for the first time. Recently, several slaves were lost in tunnels beneath the ruins, giving Graham and Ewitik cause to abandon further exploration until the problem can be determined and dealt with, directing the excavation efforts instead toward the untouched mounds of the ruins in the meantime. Kali, once a low ranking member of a minor noble family, leads the fishermen, keeping them held together as a formidable selling group, maintaining good prices for their catch. For what reason he is here is unsure as he refuses to discuss or address his past, especially when directly questioned about it.

Note (blue):
4826 Sunken Ship: Protruding from the water about 50 feet from shore is a mast, which belongs to a merchant ship lying on the rocky bottom, its hull torn by the sharp rocks just visible at high tide. Twelve feet of the 40-foot mast is visible when the tide is in, which indicates that the ship is at rest on the bottom 28 feet down. The ship is visible at low tide, but already is being swallowed by the shifting, water-propelled sands. Most of the cargo has already been salvaged, but there are still three barrels of iron nails and three silver ingots marked with the seal of the imperial treasury. Each one of these bars is roughly seven inches long, three inches thick, and four inches wide, and weighs 38 pounds. Each one is worth 76 gp, but are serially marked, so cashing them in may cause problems unless turned into the authorities.

Note (green):
4831 Harkarim Ruins (EL Varies): Vine covered earthen mounds hide most of the city ruins but two entrances to tunnels below ground exist. One is a magical door in the rock-hewn, domed pillar that rises from the middle of the mounds; the other is a small earthen tunnel opening under a large bush. The earthen tunnel leads down to a locked (Hardness 8; hp 60; Break DC 28; Open Lock DC 25) and trapped (globe of cold: CR 5; 20-ft.-radius sphere or hemisphere \[8d6\]; DC 17 Reflex save avoids; Search DC 27; Disable Device DC 25) door, beyond which are three large rock carved tunnels that branch out from a large domed circular room in which sits a statue of a unicorn. Over each tunnel entrance hangs a sign. The left tunnel sign reads, Cave of Perfect Darkness; the middle one reads, Cave of Tranquility. The tunnel from the magical pillar door leads to the dark cave that is the only safe area below. The other two tunnels hold more danger: 3 umber hulks (CR 7; hp 68) in the middle way and 3 mind flayers

(CR 8; hp 44) to the right. Three-horned gazelle browse among the mounds. A treasure with 5,000 gp and a horn of blasting lie beyond the Cave of Perfect Darkness.

Once a province capital of the an-cient Empire of Kelnore, the ruins now are known for the restless ghosts of departed rulers, undesirables and evil spirit powers. The ruins are not much to see but every stone has some residual magical power that if reconstructed as a whole would create a formidable castle indeed. Many mummies (CR 5; hp 55 each) lie sleeping under the ruins. The road to the Barradine Ruins is treacherous with bandits (War1-3).

5122 GRIMLON (Large Town): Magical; AL N, TL 5; 3,000 gp limit; Assets 371,250; Population 3,960 (Able bodied 990); Mixed (human 100% \[mostly Tharbrian and Altanian, a few Common Viridian and Skandik\]); Re-sources: trade. Authority Figure: Shah Drong Dirkahl, female marilith Wiz24 (polymorphed to human form). Important Characters: Fardoon Gewisl, male human NE Wiz14 (wizard school chancellor); Arsing of the Power, female Tharbrian LN Clr12 (Morg); Zarkar the Ham-merer, male dwarf, LN Ftr9 (guard captain); Yaharn Geln, male human N Rog8 (guildmaster of thieves); Kanta Helwo, female gnome, N Exp7 (guildmaster of artisans).

Grimlon is a strongly fortified castle perched on a hill, having stood for centuries as a safe resting spot midway on the East-West trade route. The shah appears as an old, very wise man with a timeless look but she is actually a demon of the worst sort. Her wise counsel impresses many but confuses most as to why the city is run so poorly. She encourages licentiousness and no one trusts anyone unless it's a mindless lackey. Chasm imps live in the first level dungeon and serve the shah devot-edly on command but always out of sight. Many powerful types are buried in the cemetery grove outside the curtain and could be raised if one knew how. A Great White Suit of Armor hangs in the Great Hall with this inscription: If you I fit/And horse's bit/Meets Sword of Stone/Then you I own. Three two-headed giants of Alfkinon protect the city gates and it is good they are friends with humans. They do have doubts about the shah, though. The labyrinth beneath the town is virtu-ally a world of its own, and holds the key to the liberation of the city from its terrible lord. Many traders base their operations here and are allowed to maintain small gar-risons to protect their commerce. The open air market at the center of town is busy with negotiations such items as sacks of beans or chests full of swords. Some apprentices keep track of the latest bids and offerings. Some magnates invest in art, wine and other valuables which must be guarded around the clock. Messenger birds come and go throughout the day, changing owner-ship of goods over a thousand leagues away with tiny sealed messages.
