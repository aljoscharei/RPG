There’s a dangerous schism in its ranks  
The laity is demanding much from the priests
The god’s influence has become distant 
Another dark faith is warring with it
The leadership is insane in unhelpful ways
One of its servitor monsters is out of control
It’s been impoverished by a recent trouble
Its god is making unreasonable demands
The enforcers are muscling their clerical lords

^probs
 



It’s a remnant of a now-dead culture  
It’s a sect of a better-known public faith  
It has a totemic beast or monster type  
They’re cannibals or other gustatory deviants
They were thought to be wiped out in the past 
It employs technology-like magics  
An area is tacitly understood to belong to it
It has open sympathizers among the great
They only look like humans
They serve a purpose that no longer obtains
It favors monstrous body alterations
It has a variety of potent ancient artifacts
It cuts secret deals with the ruling class
They live where normal people couldn’t
They have agents in other religious groups
A subculture of the land is friendly to it
It has a lot of servitor monsters obedient to it
It was once a public and powerful faith
It’s thought to hold back some awful doom
The visible part of the cult is but a fraction of it
