`The onset and intensity of blockade vary among muscle groups. This may be due to differences in blood flow, distance from the central circulation, or different fiber types. Furthermore, the relative sensitivity of a muscle group may depend on the choice of muscle relaxant. In general, the diaphragm, jaw, larynx, and facial muscles (orbicularis oculi) respond to and recover from muscle relaxation sooner than the thumb. Although they are a fortuitous safety feature, persistent diaphragmatic contractions can be disconcerting in the face of complete adductor pollicis paralysis. Glottic musculature is also quite resistant to blockade, as is often confirmed during laryngoscopy. The ED95 for laryngeal muscles is nearly two times that for the adductor pollicis muscle. Good intubating conditions are usually associated with visual loss of the orbicularis oculi twitch response.`

Diaphragm takes longer than larynx, less time than **glottic** structures, which is what I lazily referred to as small muscles of pharynx above. If this was different, we would be able to achieve ideal tube conditions while the pt was still breathing as opposed to waiting through 30 sec of apnea. Also diaphragm plays only a small role in maintaining resp. when you lose thoracic back-up/support muscles, a contraction of diaphragm alone ain’t doing much-hence need for tube in C6 spines.

Anesth. speak about this stuff b/c of recovery. Diaphragm comes back before pharyng and pt may get neg pressure pulm edema as a result.
