# 17: Creature Synergy

**Creature Synergy - Making the Most of Your Monsters**
Every creature has at least one exploitable weakness. This is crucial for game balance as no creature should be all-powerful.
However, it’s possible to lessen the impact of these weaknesses should you need to increase the challenge.
Pairing up different creatures is one way of doing so. Synergistic pairings bolster creature strength and shore-up weaknesses.
Every creature has unique traits and abilities that create synergies with other creatures.
The key is identifying areas of synergy within the creature’s statblock and then pairing them with creatures that can make use of them.
**Weakness is Balance**
The game rewards players who identify and leverage creature weaknesses.
The primary reward of this is that the party can kill the creatures faster. This in turn may allow them to spend fewer resources.
Weaknesses need not be obvious to the party. You can disguise or prop-up a creature’s weaknesses to make combat more challenging.
The party still gains the same benefits of finding the creatures' weaknesses. Yet, it takes more strategy and insight to do so as there are now multiple creatures with different weaknesses that they must account for.
The [gibbering mouther](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gibbering-mouther) is a prime example of this. They have tons of control and damage, but their abysmal speed makes them a non-issue for a party that can kite.
**Analyze the Creature**
Classifying the creature is the first step for creature analysis. A creature's classification reveals the general strengths and weaknesses of the creature.
Creatures might also have strengths and weaknesses separate from their classification.
For instance, a brute type creature may have below-average movement. This makes them susceptible to ranged attackers.
This isn't a shared weakness amongst brutes, ergo it’s a unique weakness.
However, what this unique weakness does reveal is that you’ll need to find a creature that can aid the brute in their goal - attacking the party.
One way to solve this problem is by throwing in artillery creatures to sit behind the brute and provide suppressing fire.
Another option is to add controllers to slow the party, allowing the brute to catch up to them.
**Pair Them Up By Role**
Classification-based pairings are a convenient method for shoring up weaknesses. Here’s a generalized list of preferred pairings based on each creature classification:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Classification** | **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** | **Example Synergy** | **Example Synergy** |
| Artillery | Damage<br>Long-ranged | Defense | A brute to absorb damage | Controllers to prevent the enemies’ advance |
| Brute | Defense | Damage | Artillery to provide cover fire | Controllers to provide buffs and support |
| Controller | Control<br>Support | Defense<br>Damage | Strikers to leverage your hard crowd control | Artillery to retaliate against ranged enemies |
| Striker | Damage<br>Mobility | Defense<br>Short-ranged | Brutes to grab the enemy’s attention in the frontlines | Controllers to enhance their movement or slow the enemy |

**Lore Pairings**
Some creatures are tailor-made to build off each other. This is often specified in creature lore like with [goblins](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters:Goblin#content) and [worgs](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters:Worg#content).
Goblins provide suppressing fire from their ranged attacks while the worgs serve as a beefy frontline.
Worgs can also serve as mounts for the goblins. This provides utility in the form of movement.
They shore up each other’s general weaknesses so they can focus on their individual strengths.
**Pairing Synergistic Damage Resistances and Immunities**
Consider damage resistances and immunities in a creature's statblock.
For instance, a creature can negate friendly fire if they have the proper damage immunity. Here are a couple of examples of this:

1.  A fire immune brute or striker won’t worry about a [hell hound](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hell%20Hound#h-Hell%20Hound)’s Fire Breath
2.  A lightning immune brute allows an Archmage to cast [Lightning Bolts](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Lightning%20Bolt#content) haphazardly

**Pairing Complementary Abilities**
Debuffs and crowd control can also create synergistic pairings.
For instance, a controller can cast [Hold Person](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hold%20Person#content) to restrain a PC. This then gives strikers an easy way to deal critical damage with their melee attacks.
**Formulate a Plan of Attack**
A three-round combat plan is a perfect resource for exploring your chosen creatures' synergies.
Your plan encompasses the first three rounds of combat. This includes what your creatures must accomplish to set themselves up for success for the rest of the encounter.
A synergy-focused three-round will focus more on how our creatures interact with each other. Leverage the identified synergies to set the tone of the encounter.
Here’s an example three-round plan:

1.  Artillery fires upon the enemy backline and moves further back to create distance

1.  Artillery continues focusing their fire on the enemy backline while moving further away from the enemy

1.  Artillery either continues to attack the enemy backline or focuses on a low HP enemy to bring them down

Our creatures each have a defined goal.
The brute exists to run interference on the party’s melee attackers. The artillery’s job is to provide suppressing fire for the brute and help the brute finish off a target.
A successful three-round plan leverages synergies to prop-up a creature’s individual weaknesses and enhances their strengths.
**Example: Pairing Up a Hell Hound**
**Relevant Creatures:**
Hell Hound [(pg 321-322 5e SRD)](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)
Magmin [(pg 329 5e SRD)](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)
A hell hound is a perfect creature for an encounter in a cavern full of molten lava. Their immunity to fire damage ensures that they're protected from the absurd heat.
The party consists of four 5th-level characters. To level-out the action economy we need a low-CR synergistic creature so we can include a handful of them.
The magmin is a fantastic choice. Their fire immunity ensures that they can survive the environment and shrug-off the hell hound’s Fire Breath.
The hell hound’s fire immunity protects it from the magmin’s Death Burst.
Ergo, both creatures can rush into the middle of the party and unleash their AoEs without fear of harming each other.
This synergistic pairing boasts flexible positioning and a torrent of multi-target fire damage.
**Playing Matchmaker**
Weaknesses are a key part of game design and balance. No creature or player character should be all-powerful. Weaknesses provide limitations.
However, you don’t need to leave a creature exposed by its weaknesses. Pairing them with synergistic creatures lessens both creatures' weaknesses.
Paired creatures use their strengths to shore-up each other's weaknesses. This makes finding and exposing individual weaknesses challenging, but still rewarding.
