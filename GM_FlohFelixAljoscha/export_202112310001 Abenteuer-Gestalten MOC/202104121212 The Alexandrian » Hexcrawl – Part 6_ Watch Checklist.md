[Hexcrawl – Part 6: Watch Checklist](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/17349/roleplaying-games/hexcrawl-part-6-watch-checklist) June 18th, 2012

This checklist pulls all of the preceding material together into a [clean procedure](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/15176/roleplaying-games/game-structures-part-8-the-importance-of-clean-structures). Simply follow the checklist for each watch, and you should generally find running the hexcrawl to be smooth sailing.
WATCH CHECKLIST
1\. DIRECTION AND MODE OF TRAVEL
2\. ARE THEY LOST?

*   If they are not following a landmark or trail, make a Navigation check.
*   If they are lost, determine veer. If they are already lost, veer can be increased but not decreased.

3\. ENCOUNTER CHECK

*   Determine time within the watch (1d8 for the half hour).
*   TIP: If encounter occurs before last half hour of travel, use travel by hour to determine progress before the encounter occurs, then jot down the number of hours left in the watch.

4\. DETERMINE ACTUAL DISTANCE TRAVELED

*   Roll 2d6+3 x 10% x Average Distance.
*   Make a Navigation check see if they accurately estimated their distance traveled.
*   TIP: If their progress would cause them to leave a hex during a watch and that would cause their terrain type to change, calculate progress by hour. When they reach the hex edge, note how many hours are left. Then you can reference the new hex, calculate the new average distance, and continue marking progress.

HEX PROGRESS

*   It takes 12 miles of progress to exit one of the hex’s 3 far faces. It takes 6 miles of progress to exit on the hex’s 3 near faces.
*   Changing direction within a hex will result in the loss of 2 miles of progress.

LEAVING A HEX

*   Determine new hex (by applying current veer to their direction of travel).
*   If they were lost, make a Navigation check to see if they recognize it. If they do, they can attempt to reorient. If they do not, veer accumulates. (Note: Using a compass automatically resets veer at the hex border even if they don’t recognize that they were off course.)
