![[Duresh Forest.png]]

The Broken armies have split here, looking to flank and pincer the Legion. One has only left a few squads to harass, while their main force pushes hard east to devour what resources the plains have, their tireless troops hunting down anything they can see in a land offering little cover. The other heads to the woods on the heels of the Legion.

Duresh is the Panyar word for these woods. In Aldermark this area is referred to as the Hellenwald—the Light Forest. When it starts out, sparse trees pepper gentle hills. But the locals that live within warn travelers to only travel as long as they can see light through the trees touching the ground. Further than that, they warn, humans are not supposed to go. The Heart of the Wood (Talgon to the Panyar, or the Alderhart in Aldermani) lies ahead, hostile to those not meant to be there. Only a Chosen might lead you through safely.

This hard-to-navigate forest is populated by Aldermani hunters, a small number of Panyar families, and all manner of wild beasts. The forest is resistant to paths, often devouring signs of passage in a matter of days. While there are fewer undead here, traveling through the forest itself can be dangerous.

There are a number of Panyar villages here, though they are small and insular. The Panyar have not been well treated by the Aldermani, being regarded with suspicion and outlandish comparisons to folklore creatures. The locals in this area aren’t fond of the Legion either, and consider the Old Empire and all its products a mistake.

The twin gods of Aldermark were part of the war: Mattiar the Smith and Gerholtz the Hunter. Before marching to war, Gerholtz wielded a spear made by his brother to deal with a blight-maddened beast. The Cacophony—a famous beast from the forest, inscribed on the seal of Aldermark—is pinned by this powerful artifact to keep it from rampaging. The Legion could use a weapon such as this—provided they can slay the beast. GM: Make a potent, threat 3, many-headed supernatural beast that reanimates once the spear is removed.

mission rewards: +2 Morale. Relic: Striking Spear (if anyone or their shadow is hit by this spear, they are rooted in place).

mission penalties: None.
