It is made from parts of a capsized stone ship. Those who study the throne for 1d4 hours gain that amount (× Level × 100) XP from their new understanding of ancient human ingenuity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The throne is made of living bodies – pact-making humans who displeased their master. Those who talk to the supplicants and study the throne gain dark insights worth (1d6 × Level × 100) XP, and 1 point of permanent Corruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Humans nailed on black monoliths provide the music. All who hear the lamentations of the tormented humans must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1d6 temporary corruption. Player characters without permanent corruption are not affected. The daemon prince demands a pact with at least one of the player characters, or else he will unleash the daemons on them – see Pact-making on page 170. The throne is roughly made from the linked remains of human buildings; beams of rusty steel, a huge and highly patinated brass bell, a rose windowof multi-colored glass. A gaming group who studies the throne gains deep insights into humanity’s origin and early history, which grants (1d6 × Level × 100) XP. |

A gaming group who searches the temple for 1d4 hours gains (1d6 × Level × 100) XP from dark insights, as well as 1d4 temporary Corruption. They also find a minor artifact. Furthermore, their search awakens a daemon or abomination (challenge rating equals highest character level) that attacks the player characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Everyone on board is either dead or blight born. A group who searches the giant vessel gains insights worth (1d6 × Level × 100) XP and finds strange and valuable items worth 1d10 × 100 thaler. They are also attacked by two waves of thoroughly corrupted sailors, stats as Dragoul (a total of three times the number of characters, divided evenly between each wave).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Those trapped in the storm gain 1d8 temporary corruption and take 2d12 bludgeoning damage from the suffocating sand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 15   | The ground turns into treacherous mud                                          | Each character must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the danger. Those that fail become stuck in the mud. Rescuing a creature from the mud requires a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Stuck creatures have three rounds to be rescued, afterwards they sink into and drown in the mud. Stuck creatures and rescuers gain 1d4 Corruption from the blighted mud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 16   | Pointy rooftops of copper protrude from the ground                             | The player characters find themselves on the roof of a huge building, buried in deep and thick mud. Those who spend 1d4 hours digging, finally reach the top floor and find a minor artifact. Frescoes provide clues about human history worth (1d6 × Level × 100) XP. Anyone digging this way inside the building gains 1d6 temporary Corruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 17   | Doomsday clock of rusty iron                                                   | The mechanical clock has stopped at two minutes to midnight. A player character with the feature Artifact Crafting or Blacksmith can salvage the clockwork from the clock itself and make it tick again. It then works as a mechanical version of the artifact Xtala’s hourglass (see page 143).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 18   | Interrupted aqueduct that no longer carries water, but thick, blighted mud.    | With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, the player character finds a raft of glass up on the aqueduct, covered with dust. The character can use it to ride the river of mud at double walking speed, but the course is set by the aqueduct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 19   | A beach of skulls and bones by a vast sea of fuming acid.                      | As the player characters approach the beach, something moves underneath the surface, creating ripples on the acid’s otherwise mirror-like surface. The Alchemy feature: a melee weapon or projectile for a ranged weapon dipped in the lake will forever deal half damage (rounded down), but now counts as Poison damage instead of its original damage type. A person who disturbs the calm surface of the lake (e.g. dipping a weapon into it) is attacked by an abomination with stats as Hammer Eel (see the Bestiary, page 128), but thoroughly corrupted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 20   | A glass pyramid protrudes from the ground, its interior teeming with movement. | Further investigation reveals that the pyramid is full of blight born humans, fighting to break free from their glass prison. Seeing the player characters increases their frenzy, and a famished roar is heard ever so faintly through the thick glass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
