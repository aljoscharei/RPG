Undead PCs

Undead player characters are thoroughly corrupt from the start. Like others of their kind, the undead character has a mind and free will; they are not howling abominations bent on destruction.

-   Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increas- es by 2. Increase any other ability score by 1.
    
-   Age. Undead are exclusively human in origin. They can have died their first death at almost any age after attain- ing adulthood. If they can maintain themselves (see be- low), they can live for centuries.
    
-   Size. Undead are of human stock and thus vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first level you have 8 hit points plus your Constitution modifier. When you gain a level in any class, you gain 5 (1d8) plus your Constitution modifier hit points. You do not gain a Hit Die, see Undead (below).
    
-   Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
    
-   Darkvision. A creature of Corruption and death, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t
    
    discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

    usually either Ambrian or Barbarian.
    
-   Physical Degeneration. The undead have no souls, and
    
    any Corruption that they accrue instead causes phys- ical degeneration of their body. This is represented by your current Corruption total reducing your current and maximum hit points on a 1:1 basis. If you exceed your Corruption Threshold, you roll for marks of Corruption as normal.
    
    If your total Corruption equals or exceeds your cur- rent hit points you become unconscious (but stable) until your Corruption is reduced or your hit points increase (an


unconscious undead creature counts as taking a short or longer rest if they remain undisturbed). If you acquire more permanent Corruption than your Corruption Threshold (see page 37) then your character is no longer playable.

example: An undead sorcerer gains 1d4+3 temporary Cor- ruption for a 3rd level spell, rolling 2 + 3 for a total of 5. Their current and maximum hp totals are reduced by 5.

• Undead. You do not sleep, cannot eat normal food, do not need to breathe (except to talk). You can drink small amounts of liquid. You do not naturally heal during a short or long rest, instead you must either drink blood or consume raw flesh during a long rest to restore your single Hit Die, which you can then use to regain hit points or reduce temporary Corruption. You can benefit from healing magic.

When you interact with the living, you must make a Charisma (Deception) check against their passive Insight in order to fool them. However, a character with Shadow- sight or an active spell that allows them to see Shadows might still recognize you as undead.



Undead Backgrounds

whiLe each unDeaD person has their own personal history, they also share some commonalities as they have made the transition from death into unlife. The new form of undead has become known as revenants, those who have returned for some reason.

Revenant

You have been reborn in a way, or at least you did not stay dead. You didn’t choose this fate for yourself (or at least, that’s what you tell others) but you must constantly be on guard against witch hunters and Black Cloaks.

Feature: Undead

You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condi- tion. Diseases do not affect you.

Suggested Characteristics

The undead have a wide variety of beliefs and understand- ings. However, their need for secrecy and desire to under- stand their new ‘life’ is nearly universal.
