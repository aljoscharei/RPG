Journey to the temple of exaltation
Annotations
1. P16d4 sovereign oath: those barbarians from the north or their allies from baiaga or
karohar. I was not aware that they dared to venture so far south
2. P18d7 Chieftain (no troops)
3. D20p9 Ranger camps (not army ...)
4. P21d10 south of the mound erased. Sovereign Oath -->northern clans
5. P22d11 sovereign troops erased
6. P23d12 Sovereign warrior -->northern the {rise of the sovereign oath and the} blood
daughter. At least now we have a name to give to those renegade tribes. Army of
symbaroum→ army of the blood daughter. Initiate Rann and Morea into THEIR oath.
7. P25d16 And with squires and a couple of priests as their slaves. (Can’t imagine the First
Revenger will let this go unpunished...)
8. P29d20 Another confirmation that Clan Baiaga has truly splintered
9. P33d26 no edrafin’s deceitful promise...
10. P37d30 Harlar does not have a firetube
11. P47d38 I am not sure and I know it sounds crazy but I think I might have killed Howla.
Sure another rage troll may have taken the necklace after she died, but my gut tells me otherwise, that this troll was Howla. Those eyes, the body-posture, surely were those of Howla
12. P49d42 the western borderlands → a former symbarian Villa west of odaban
13. P54d49 Alavans name is unreadible
