This community used to be much larger and more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. Only a tithe of citizens remain on the site, and much of its former architecture is crumbling and abandoned. A few weathered tokens of old glory remain, and some may be jealously maintained, but there simply aren’t enough locals left to keep up what they’ve inherited.

5.  E  Looter seeking to plunder the remains, Zealot with a plan to return to glory, Outsider strongman who wants to coerce the locals into obedience
    
6.  F  Learned scholar of the noble past, Hard-scrabble present survivor, New citizen who sees hope in the place
    

C They don’t fully understand what they’ve inherited, They were crushed because of their past evils, They’re not the actual heirs but merely squatters who moved into the empty place

T Artifact of the prior golden age, Wealth hidden away long ago, Secret key to unlocking new glory

P Near-abandoned city center, Massive decaying monument, Partially fallen town wall
