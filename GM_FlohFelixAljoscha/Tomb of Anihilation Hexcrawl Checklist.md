Survival in brief

When travelling through the wilderness, three important rolls are made.

-   After plotting the route, and determining the travel pace, the navigator makes a Wisdom (Survival) check to stay on course.
    
-   A member of the party rolls the resource die, or if bust, rolls a Wisdom (Survival) check to locate safe food, water and and shelter.
    
-   The DM secretly checks for wilderness encounters, presenting them in a narratively satisfying way.
    

The Resource Die

Nobody likes tracking rations, so instead we use a resource die, 1d6. At the end of each day, the die is rolled to determine how the party resources are doing. On a 1, or a 2, something dramatic has happened that effects your supplies. The die now decreases one step, making the same event more likely as the adventure continues (1d6, 1d4, 1d2, **bust**).

Before the party enter the Jungle, check for any of the following and increase their starting resource die by one step for each, to a maximum 1d12. Keep this meta information to yourself, express it only through NPC interactions:

-   A **good** wilderness guide
    
-   Spending additional gold on resources <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">(GP equal to 10*creatures in the party</sup>)
    
-   A Ranger in their favoured terrain
    
-   A feature, trait, or spell that negates or improves food/water tracking
    

The die can be replenished partially or completely at the DM's discretion using these methods:

-   Encountering a supplies cache <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">(Keep these on your map once encountered</sup>)
    
-   Spending a day of downtime in a friendly, occupied settlement
    
-   Negotiating with NPCs in the wilderness
    
-   Conducting successful theft/raids on hostile settlements or expeditionary parties.
    
-   Discovering Ryath roots, Olisuba leaves, Sinda berries, or Wildroots.
    

  

Rolling a 1, or a 2

When the resource die decreases one step, take the opportunity to make something dramatic happen, specifically in relation to the party resources. The events of the day may inspire this, but this is also a **really neat opportunity for disease** or non-combat encounters. Here are a few ideas, but generally I like to keep this loose so I can improvise when the time arises:

-   Some of the waterskins are missing, and the rest have been filled with a contaminated water source. The party saves against throat leaches. Perhaps this is the fault of a less than appropriate wilderness guide.
    
-   Someone's insect repellant has run out, wasn't applied properly, or a poor quality version has been sold to the party. Save against shivering sickness.
    
-   An otherwise encounter-less day sees rival adventurers stalking the party, waiting for a member to be isolated or fall asleep, so they can steal from their bags. Roll for an additional combat encounter, a humanoid NPC uses the the confusion to loot camp.
    
-   Chwingas socialise with the party, but secretly steal some important resources. Take some actual inventory, perhaps some gold or a family heirloom, and throw the same encounter in a few days later, to see if the party can retake their equipment.
    

  

Going bust

The party's rations are expended, their hammocks torn, insect repellant stolen, cookware destroyed, waterskins pierced. You're now living entirely on the land, and must roll an additional survival check at the end each day to find safe food, water, and shelter.

The tables in the next section provide examples of varying survival DC's. Consider only allowing the help action from people proficient in Survival. If the check fails, points of exhaustion are not removed for this rest, and each member of the party suffers one additional level of exhaustion.

Consider that this exhaustion represents considerable dehydration in a very deadly climate, and any mounting levels of exhaustion may represent the much slower effects of starvation, or the culminating effects of chronic sleep deprivation.

**Variant:** If your players have created characters with features to improve foraging, camping or the collection of water, consider making separate checks for food/water/shelter once the resource die is bust. Situations where the party are bust are rare, so its unlikely to be laborious, especially if they're asking to engage with their features. In such an event, have the party assign roles and use different failure conditions. If there are more than two failures, points of exhaustion are not removed during this rest.

-   **Food**. Disease encounter, or combat encounter with a rival, dangerous plant or predator.
    
-   **Water**. Party gains one point of exhaustion.
    
-   **Shelter**. Party regain 1/4 their hit dice on a long rest, and half max HP.
    

Travel Table

I wanted there to be a cost/benefit of navigating through different terrain. Appoint a group navigator, give that person an empty copy of the table below and provide them information on new terrain as the jungle is explored. They'll learn the different types of terrain, their cost:benefit, and the group will start making decisions based on that information.

The majority of terrain is rainforest, so there needs to be benefit for trawling through regions teeming with undead. Perhaps an increasing lack of large herbivores in regions of undead, making plant-life more abundant and overgrown. The higher navigation DC reflects the abnormally thick canopy, denser underbrush, or efforts to avoid swarms.

For rivers, we need a downside for the speed boost. As with real rainforests, creatures of the jungle will naturally flock to the life giving waters, making it a dangerous area. The risk of encounters therefore should be higher. Make sure the guides mention this too, or at the very least have common Chultans raise the point before the first outing - setting up the expectation for meaningful travel choices.

Swamps and Mountains have greater visibility for the surrounding area, reflected in their navigation DC. For mountains or hills, consider revealing a greater number of Hexes if you're using Roll20 or another concealed hex method. For context, for an observer standing 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level, the horizon is at a distance of 36 kilometres (22 mi). Keep this in mind when visiting Kir Sabal.

If you have a flying party member who flies above the jungle canopy, consider revealing surrounding areas if they fly to an altitude of 330ft, but at the risk of an aerial combat encounter or announcing their presence to nearby factions. Bear in mind, the average height of canopy trees in rainforests is 35-42 meters (115–137 feet), but the tallest trees may reach 84 meters (275 feet).

**RAW rules on travel pace:**

-   **Slow** - Travel distance is halved. Stealth is possible, and if not out in the open the party can attempt to surprise other creatures.
    
-   **Normal**
    
-   **Fast** - Travel distance is doubled. Stealth is not possible, and passive perception scores suffer a penalty of -5.

## Weather
Thoughts on Weather

I run using Roll20, which makes my life much easier through a handful of simple macros. I have a daily check button which gives me a neat little readout of weather, heat, and then whether there's a morning/noon/night encounter. The weather tables are actually really handy with providing complications which impact travel decisions or provide lingering issues.

**Variant.** If I were running IRL, I probably wouldn't check for weather in this way **BUT** I might consider stealing an abridged D20 blizzard rule from Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden to make it much easier. In this case, don't bother rolling on the weather table, just pick one.

_"When rolling for random encounters, roll an additional 1d100 and add one. If the result is equal to, or greater than the encounter number, the encounter occurs in extreme weather. The weather occurs 1d4 hours before the encounter is triggered, and lasts for 1d4 hours afterward."_

For those of you who're interested in probability for the variant, in combination with the RAW TOA random encounter checks:

-   25% of a single random encounter
    
-   6.25% of two random encounters
    
-   1.56% of three random encounters
    
-   51.5% chance that any given random encounter triggers extreme weather, roughly 12.8% chance on most days.
    

**Roll20 Weather Table**

| No Rain                  | 20% (01-20) |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Light Rain               | 50% (21-70) |
| Light Rain, Strong Winds | 10% (71-80) |
| Heavy Rain               | 10% (81-90) |
| Tropical Storm           | 10% (91-00) |

  

**Roll20 Heat Table**

| Cool Weather | 25% (01-25) |
| --- | --- |
| Hot Weather | 65% (26-90) |
| Extreme Heat | 10% (91-00) |

  

Weather Rules

These are all available between the DMG, and the adventure itself but for the sake of keeping them all together in one resource, I've provided them here. For added interest in combat, consider throwing a **lightning storm**, or perhaps a **forest fire**.

**Extreme Heat.** Party members must succeed on a DC5 Constitution Saving Throw or suffer one point of exhaustion. The roll is made with disadvantage if the creature is wearing medium or heavy armour, or is clad in heavy clothing. Creatures with fire immunity or are adapted to hot climates succeed automatically. The DC increases by 5 for each successive day of extreme heat, and an additional 5 if the resource die is bust.

**Heavy Rain.** Visibility is limited to 150 feet and beyond that distance only huge or larger objects can be distinguished. Missile weapon ranges are halved.

**Tropical Storm.** Visibility is limited to 150 feet. Missile weapon ranges are halved. Travel by river is impossible and characters travelling by foot gain 1 level of exhaustion automatically and must make a successful DC10 Constitution check or gain another. Skill checks to avoid becoming lost are made with disadvantage.

  

Filling in the Narrative

Now we've got a few more things to play with, decisions are being made, events are happening, and its easier as the DM to fill in some narrative gaps without a lot of prep. There's always something going on to riff on, environments are more likely to vary, and the story of the party's interaction with wilderness has a little more weight to it.

I have a very roleplay heavy group of friends, so a lot of this time may spent interacting with each other and developing character. If there's an NPC guide, its a great opportunity to detail some of the mysteries of the Chultan rainforest, or discuss in character whatever mysterious plot threads you've established. Heck, give your warlock exhaustion induced nightmares from their patron, guide the cleric to a stream in their hour of need, or otherwise add some cool flourishes that loosely tie with the plot.

If you later decide to stop using the travel rules, or find a way of navigating the skies using a skyship, or even acquiring the gift of flight from Aarakocra, then hopefully this experience may provide a more satisfying feeling of _"we've beat the rainforest",_ rather than _"I'm tired of rolling random encounters every Hex"_. Hopefully.

  

Keeping Watch

Honestly, in my experience as a player, or as a regular consumer of live play DnD, I think watches normally come across as boring. We go through the motions, asking about the watch cycle, and in the absence of a random encounter we struggle to come up with anything meaningful as a DM.

Considering the amount of hexes that will be traversed in TOA, that's a lot of _"What's your watch cycle tonight?"_ and even more _"Your watch goes by without issue"_. So instead, I'm not going to ask unless I need to know.

This does pose a bit of a meta issue though, as players will immediately suspect a combat encounter on the horizon when you ask for details on their watch cycle. I find that expectation is the killer of potential social or careful trap encounters, and managing expectation is key to making players imaginative about their options - especially as many intelligent antagonists in the rainforest could be treated with. I also believe that good nighttime combat encounters benefit from some narrative ambiguity and development of tension beforehand - something which is harder to do if asking for watches is directly associated with a fight.

My solution? Regardless of whether or not theres an evening encounter, occasionally ask a player what their character does with their evening, enable a roleplaying moment, and associate the thought of "taking watch" with an opportunity to be creative, rather than associating it with unavoidable combat, or a mindless motion codified by the rules.

  

Information to give your players.

This is quite a large post, mainly to convey my internal thoughts to other DM's. This isn't the way to introduce players to this system though. Everything from this point onward is the actual information I give to my own players in handout form. Resource die can be discussed in session 0 but this makes the most sense when you're also able to see the map of Chult.

**Survival in brief**

When travelling through the wilderness, three important rolls are made.

-   After plotting the route, the navigator makes a Wisdom (Survival) check to stay on course.
    
-   A member of the party rolls the resource die, or if bust, rolls a Wisdom (Survival) check to locate safe food, water and and shelter.
    
-   The DM secretly checks for wilderness encounters. 
    

**Restocking Supplies in the Wilderness**

The survival dice triggers an event and reduces in size each time a 1 or a 2 is rolled, and going bust comes with challenging penalties. The die can be replenished at the DM's discretion using these methods:

-   Encountering a supplies cache
    
-   Spending a day of downtime in a safe environment
    
-   Negotiating support from NPCs in the wilderness
    
-   Conducting theft/raids on hostile settlements or expeditionary parties.
    

**Travel Pace**

-   **Slow** - Travel distance is halved. Stealth is possible, and if not out in the open the party can attempt to surprise other creatures.
    
-   **Normal**
    
-   **Fast** - Travel distance is doubled. Stealth is not possible, and passive perception scores suffer a penalty of -5.

# Variante 2
-   DM determines location on [map](http://prints.mikeschley.com/p923843744/h956e8d5c#h956e8d5c).
-   DM determines weather. Roll d20:<sup>(*)</sup>
    -   1-16: Occasional light rain: proceed as normal
    -   17-19: Heavy rain: Visibility limited to 150 feet
    -   20: Tropical storm: travel by canoe impossible, travel on foot gains 1 level of exhaustion, DC 10 Constitution save for another. Disadvantage on checks to avoid becoming lost
-   Party determines navigator, pace, direction:
    -   Normal pace: 2 hexes per day by canoe, 1 hex per day by foot. For rivers, upstream and downstream have no effect, and waterfalls occur every 10 to 20 miles (requiring portage of canoes).
    -   Slow pace: 50% chance of 1 fewer hex per day, can hide from encounters or approach stealthily
    -   Fast pace: 50% chance of 1 more hex per day, -5 to passive Perception
    -   Parties with a Ranger are not slowed if in their favored terrain. Therefore<sup>(*)</sup>, they gain the benefits of a slow pace without the chance of 1 fewer hex per day.
# DM rolls Wisdom (Survival) for Navigator:
-   DC 10 for coasts and lakes
-   DC 15 for jungles, mountains, rivers, swamps, and wastelands
-   Add to roll +5 for slow pace, -5 for fast pace
-   If lost, roll a d6 to determine which neighboring hex the party enters. Players are not shown their location on the map in this case.
-   Parties with a Ranger in their favored terrain cannot become lost in normal navigation.
-   DM rolls d20 three times for random encounters (morning, afternoon, night). On a roll of 16 or higher, roll d100 and consult Appendix B based on terrain and, if in jungle, level of undead presence. Insert as appropriate during the travel sequence.
# Party checks for dehydration and malnourishment.
-   Characters can forage water if they succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. A similar check can yield foraged food.
-   A successful forage yields (1d6 + Wisdom modifier) gallons of water or pounds of food, although each type of forage requires its own roll.
-   Foraging characters do not contribute to the group’s ability to notice threats.
-   Rangers in their favored terrain gather twice as much food and are able to notice threats while foraging.
-   Water from rivers and lakes should be boiled first.
-   Raincatchers (ToA p. 32) can catch 2 gallons of water per inch of rain and hold up to 8 gallons.
-   On heavy rain days, roll d4 for inches of rain. On storm days, assume full 4 inches or more.<sup>(*)</sup>
-   Characters with <2 gallons of water must make DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion (disadvantage if wearing heavy clothing or medium or heavy armor). Traveling at a fast pace adds -5 penalty to this saving throw. (According to the PHB, if the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels.)
-   Characters with the Wanderer background feature (typically Outlanders) can automatically find food and fresh water for themselves and up to five other people each day in suitable terrain.

-   Expend 1 unit of rations (1 pound of food).
-   Each day after (3 plus Constitution modifier) days without food, a character gains 1 level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets this counter to 0.
