A GM is often dubious about their own creations; they have the general thread of an idea but they aren’t certain it’s the right idea. Sometimes they’re confronted with a concept or a twist that’s attractive, but just not quite right.

These tables offer some randomized prompts for sit- uations, NPCs, or just general adventure and campaign ideas. When you hit a block in your creations or want to spice up a too-bland adventure outline, pick one or more of the tables and roll or choose from the results to twist an adventure element, get an oracular assessment of an adventure fact, or throw in a random event that might complicate the plans of both heroes and antagonists. When adding these twists, however, take care that they don’t have too many assumptions about PC responses or fix outcomes as inevitable despite PC involvement.
