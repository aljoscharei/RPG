## FULL HEXCRAWL PROCEDURE  


**1. DIRECTION & TRAVEL PACE**.

-   Determine the expedition’s navigator.
-   Navigator determines intended direction and travel pace. [[Wilderness Travel Distance]]

**2. ENCOUNTER CHECK**. Roll 1d12. On a roll of 12, the location keyed to the hex has been encountered. [[Hex Exploration]] On a roll of 1:

-   If in a border hex, check to see which encounter table should be used.
-   Roll on the wandering encounter table.
-   Check % Tracks.
-   Check % Lair.
-   If it’s a wandering encounter or lair, make an encounter reaction check. See [[Hexcrawl Encounter]]

**3. WATCH ACTIONS**. Resolve all watch actions [[watch actions]]

**4. ARE THEY LOST?**

-   If they are not following a landmark or trail, make a Navigation check. [[navigation]]
-   If they are lost, determine veer. If they are already lost, veer can be increased but not decreased.

**5. HEX PROGRESS** [[Wilderness Travel Distance]]

- Ich zähle die Punkte des Brushes auf Procreate. Das ist die Distanz die sie laufen können.
**Das hier benutze ich nicht**
> It takes 12 miles of progress to exit one of the hex’s 3 far faces.
> It takes 6 miles of progress to exit one of the hex’s 2 near faces.
> Changing direction within a hex will result in the loss of 2 miles of progress.
> If characters double back, reduce progress until they exit the hex. If they leave the hex by any other route, it requires an additional 1d6-1 miles of progress to exit the hex.

**LEAVING A HEX**:

-   Determine new hex (by applying current veer to the expedition’s direction of travel).
-   If they were lost, make a Navigation check to see if they recognize it. If they do, they can attempt to reorient. If they do not, veer accumulates. (Note: Using a compass automatically resets veer at the hex border even if they don’t recognize they were off course.)
