An ancient Deep once was located here, but time,

warfare, or disaster caused it to collapse. A significant portion of the surface has likely subsided to form an uneven crater. Small sections of the Deep might still be accessible from the surface, and dangerous uncollapsed passageways may still connect these smaller zones. The heirs of the survivors may still persist on the surface or they may have long since died out to natural hazards or dispersion.

E Buried undying lord, Surface looter with dreams of rule, The thing that caused the collapse

F Friendly survivor descendant, Curious explorer, Native guide to the ancient pit

C Things below are digging their way up, The Deep is leaking something dangerous, The collapse was recent and monstrous survivors still flee

T Priceless Deep treasure cast up, Exposed arcane components, Potent relic carried by survivors

P Ancient vault torn in two, Crevasse cutting through a hundred ruined levels, Buckled structure fragment jutting through the surface
