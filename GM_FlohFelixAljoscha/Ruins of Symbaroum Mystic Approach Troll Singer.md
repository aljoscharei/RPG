Titles

Troll singers have no titles, but follow a simple apprenticeship system where a promising singer learns from a master. When an apprentice has learned enough they are tasked with serving the rulers as best they can, and later on the time comes to pass knowledge and skills on to some new apprentice.

Corruption

To willingly accept Corruption is unthinkable to most troll singers. Through the songs, the trolls remember the world as it was before the Corruption, long before humans arrived and started building their empires. When Sym- baroum grew dark from hunger and rapacity, the trolls welcomed the elven intervention; they supported the Iron Pact and contributed to the birth of Davokar. At least this is said in the songs.

Nowadays, the trolls live beneath the woods in the Abyss where darkness broods; in cavities and caves it gathers in pools of malice. These birthplaces of abominations remind all trolls, singer or not, that the twilight or winter of the world has come. They also know that this twilight cannot be expelled by the eerie lights glowing in their underground halls; that this is a winter during which even the temperatures of the Underworld will not protect them from being bitten by the frost.

Spellcasting Ability

As Troll Singing is dependent on the performance of singer and song, the spellcasting ability modifier is **Charisma**. You learn spells from the Troll Singer tradition list. [[Ruins of Symbaroum Troll Singer Spells]]

Each spell must be sung, which always requires at least one action. If a troll singer wishes to cast a spell at a higher level they must sing an additional round for each level they wish to add. They then make their saving throw (see below) at the base spell level.

Spells whose casting time is longer than an action use the same unit of time for each spell level upgrade. For example casting geas as a 7th level spell would require 3 minutes (1 minute for the base casting, 1 minute for each spell level upgraded).

Songs of the Dawn
- Troll singers do not gain temporary Corruption for singing their spells. Instead they must make a Charisma saving throw for each leveled casting, gaining a point of permanent Corruption on a failure. 
- If a spell is favored, you have advantage on the saving throw. If the spell is unfavored, you gain disadvantage instead. 
- Troll singers automatically succeed at casting cantrips. 
- The DC is based on the spell level, using the chart below (the DC is equal to double the spell level plus 12).

- Songs of the Dusk
	- At 3rd level troll singers have mastered the ability to invoke some of their ancient magic without the threat of Corruption. You can cast spells with a **level total of up to twice your proficiency bonus**, with a **maximum spell level equal to your proficiency bonus** without Corruption. You recover used spell levels when you complete a **long rest.**
	- example: If you are a 13th level troll singer, you could cast up to a 5th level spell without a saving throw and then cast two 1st level spells and a 3rd level spell, or any other com- bination of spells totalling 10 spell levels.
- Songs of the Masters
	- At 6th, 9th, 13th and 17th level, troll singers can learn **one** of the following songs. You begin a song by using your action on your turn. Any creature affected by the spell must be within 60 feet of you and able to hear you. You must concentrate on these magical songs just like spells. You can use a bonus action on subsequent turns to continue the same song to maintain it up to 1 minute. Singing a spell, singing a new song or ending the song causes the effect to end.
	- Combat Hymn
		- There is a raw and untamed power in singing, and some mystics learn to sing while fighting to gain considerable extra strength when battling the enemy. When you sing this song, you and up to six allies gain a bonus equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) to your attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. Your weapon damage now counts as magical. You must take a short or longer rest before singing this song again.
	- Dancing Weapon
		- When you sing this song, a simple one-handed weapon that belongs to you becomes animated and can hover up to 6 feet above the ground. Other than this, it remains as it was. If it is magical, you can use any magical effect as if you were
		- wielding the weapon yourself. On your initiative it can move up to 30 feet and then make a single attack roll. It uses your Charisma modifier and your proficiency bonus for attack rolls and your Charisma modifier for damage. You must take a short or longer rest before singing this song again. Similar to [[5e Spells spiritual weapon d8 20 ft  summoned lightbringer c]] but longer movement
	- Heroic Hymn
		- When you sing this song you and up to six friendly creatures gain advantage on Dexterity, Constitution or Wisdom saving throws (the same saving throw for each). You must take a short or longer rest before singing this song again
	- Retribution Hymn
		- Choose an enemy creature that you can see. It must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, when the creature does damage to you, you split the damage evenly between the two of you. In the case of an odd division, you receive the extra point of damage. You must take a short or longer rest before singing this song again.
	- Sustaining Hymn
		- When you begin this spell and on the start of your turn as long as you continue singing this song, you and up to six allies gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier. You must take a short or longer rest before singing this song again.
	- Weakening Hymn
		- As an action, you can force up to seven creatures of your choice to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure they have disadvantage on all saving throws until the song ends. On a success they are immune to this song for 24 hours. If you continue your singing, then a creature that failed the saving throw can repeat it at the end of their turn (with disadvantage) in order to become immune for 24 hours as above. You must take a short or longer rest before singing this song again.
