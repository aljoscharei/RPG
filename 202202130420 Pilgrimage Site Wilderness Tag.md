There is some important monument, place, or structure here that attracts pilgrims from far away. It may be a holy site beloved of a local faith, a mythic origin- point for a nearby culture, an oracle or other provider of widely-desired services, or a font of some special favor or benefit that can reward a pilgrim. The site may be under the control of a local government, or it may be too distant or dangerous to be effectively protected or administered by outsiders.
